More speci\ufb01cally it is about using\noptions to make trades that are primarily dependent on the range of\nthe underlying instrument rather than its direction.\nBefore discussing technicalities, I want to give a brief description of\nmy trading philosophy. In trading, as in most things, it is necessary to havegeneral guiding principles in order to succeed. Not everyone need agree\non the speci\ufb01c philosophy, but its existence is essential. For example, itis possible to be a successful stock market investor by focusing on value-\nstyle investing, buying stocks with low price-to-earnings or price-to-book\nratios. It is also possible to be a successful growth investor, buying stocks\nin companies that have rapidly expanding earnings. It is not possible to\nsucceed consistently by randomly acquiring stocks and hoping that things\njust work out.\nI am a trader. I am not a mathematician, \ufb01nancial engineer, or philoso-\npher. My success is measured in pro\ufb01ts. The tools I use and develop needonly be useful. They need not be consistent, provable, profound, or even\ntrue. My approach to trading is mathematical, but I am no more interested\nin mathematics than a mechanic is interested in his tools. However, a cer-tain level of knowledge, familiarity, and even respect is needed to get the\nmost out of these tools.\nThere will be no attempt here to give a list of trading rules. Sorry, but\nmarkets constantly evolve and rules rapidly become obsolete. What willnot become obsolete are general principles. These are what I will attempt\nto provide. This approach isn\u2019t as easy to digest as a list of magic rules, but Ido not claim markets are easy to beat, either. The speci\ufb01cs of any trade will\nalways be different, but general guidelines can always point us somewhat\nin the right direction. Some latitude in strategy is desirable and adaptabilityis essential, but there are also a number of things that have to be \ufb01rmly in\nplace in order to succeed. Picasso and Braque may have broken a lot of\nrules, but they could certainly paint technically very well before they did\nso. Before you start adjusting, make sure you have a good grasp of the\n1\nint JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:12 Char Count=\n2 VOLATILITY TRADING\nfundamental aspects on which all trades need to be based: edge, variance,\nand appropriate size.\nCertain old-school traders have used arguments like \u201cTrading is about\nhumans. Your models can\u2019t capture the human element.\u201d This generallyseems to be said in a defensive manner. Maybe their models can\u2019t cap-\nture the human element, but ours will capture at least part of it. Mostof the reluctance of such traders to embrace quantitative techniquescan be attributed to defensiveness and aversion to change. It probably\nisn\u2019t due to any deep aversion to quanti\ufb01cation. After all, in the same\nway that traditional baseball people hate the new statistical analysesbut are \ufb01ne with batting average and earned run averages, many tradi-\ntional option traders denigrate quantitative analysis while being perfectly\nhappy with the Black-Scholes-Merton paradigm and the concept of im-plied volatility. They are probably just unwilling to admit that they need\nto continue to learn and are worried that their skills are becoming ob-\nsolete. They should be. We all should be. This is a continually evolvingprocess.\nHowever, when successful traders say something like this, we need\nto consider that they may be partly correct. Some traders do indeed have\ufb01nely honed intuition, generally called feelwhen applied to market sense.\nIntuition exists and can even be developed, but generally not quickly. Also,just because some traders have feel does not mean all, or even many, do.\nThe approach we develop based on mathematics and measurement can be\nsystematically learned. Given that it can be learned, what excuse is therenot to learn it? Further, while a logic-based trader may never be able to de-\nvelop effective intuition, an intuitive trader can always bene\ufb01t from logic-\nbased reasoning.\nWhile markets are designed and populated by human traders, with\ntheir typical human emotions and foibles, there is no justi\ufb01cation forusing this as a reason to avoid quanti\ufb01cation and measurement. Baseballis also a game played by humans, and batting average is a useful way to\nmeasure the quality of a hitter. Similarly, before making a trade we need\nto be able to somehow quantify the level of risk we will be incurring andthe amount of edge we expect to gather. This is exactly what mathemat-\nics is good for. Estimating return and risk (however we de\ufb01ne it) is purely\na mathematical task. If something cannot be measured it cannot be man-aged. Further, if the human element is going to be important to our success,\nit will need to have measurable effects. The markets may indeed be driven\nby animal spirits, but I will remain thoroughly agnostic until they turn into\npoltergeists and start to actually throw prices around.\nPragmatism must always be our guiding philosophy. When I have had\nto choose between including something because I have found it useful, oromitting it because I could not prove it, I have tended to err on the side of\nint JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:12 Char Count=\nIntroduction 3\ninclusion. Successful trading is based on making correct decisions under\nconditions of uncertainty and incomplete information. There will always\nbe things that we suspect are true but cannot prove. Waiting for proof may\nwell mean waiting until the methods are no longer useful.\nThere are almost certainly other ways to trade options successfully.\nWhat I offer is away, not theway. It is very much a data-driven, statistically\noriented approach that needs to be applied over a wide range of products.It is like hunting with a shotgun rather than a ri\ufb02e (actually, it may well\nbe more like carpet bombing from 30,000 feet). But even traders who fo-\ncus on one or two markets should be able to \ufb01nd some things useful anddirectly applicable.

While most\ntraders will be more pro\ufb01cient in one of the three aspects than the others,they must all be present for a trading operation to be a success.\nWhen trading options, \ufb01nding an edge involves forecasting volatility\nand understanding how volatility determines the market price of options.\nThis means we need a model for translating between price space and\nvolatility space. Over the past 40 years, traders and \ufb01nancial engineershave proposed a number of option pricing models of varying complexity.\nWe choose to use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) methodology. Traders\nhave learned to think in BSM terms. As a trader once said to me, \u201cI want amodel that a lot of guys have blown up using.\u201d He meant that a good model\nwas one whose weaknesses were well known and had been discovered by\nsomeone else\u2019s misfortune, rather than one whose weaknesses have yetto be discovered. (Ironically, the same trader later blew up using the BSM\nparadigm. So it goes.)\nThere is a misconception that more complex models are better. But it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how complex the model is. If a trader sells an option for 5.0and buys it back for 3.0, he makes two ticks no matter what model he is us-\ning. A model is just a way to formulate our thoughts and translate betweenour volatility forecasts and the option prices. If someone is comfortable\nwith a stochastic volatility model, he is more than welcome to use it. How-\never, I have found the BSM framework is robust enough to have a numberof modi\ufb01cations added to it to make it more representative of reality while\nstill remaining simple and intuitive.\nint JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:12 Char Count=\n4 VOLATILITY TRADING\nWhile most stock and commodity options are American style and\nhence not technically priced using this equation,1knowledge of the deriva-\ntion of the pricing equation is necessary to get any feel for options. In our\nderivation we will emphasize the elements that we hope to pro\ufb01t from. Themarket thinks in Black-Scholes terms, and to trade against it we need to\nunderstand what it really means. Trading is like a debate: In order to sen-\nsibly disagree with someone, we need to at least understand what they aresaying.\nOur derivation of this model in Chapter 1 is very informal. It directly\nproceeds from the starting point of holding a directionally neutral portfo-lio and shows how adjusting this dynamically leads to the BSM equation.\nIt also makes clear the direct dependence of the equation on the range of\nthe underlying and how this is proxied by volatility of returns. We also em-phasize all the approximations and assumptions that are needed to arrive\nat the BSM equation. The rest of this book shows in detail how to deal with\nand pro\ufb01tably trade these inadequacies.\nThe largest source of edge in option trading is in trading our estimate\nof future volatility against the markets. Before we can forecast volatilitywe need to be able to measure it. In Chapter 2 we look at methods ofhistorical volatility measurement including close-to-close volatility, Parkin-\nson volatility, Rogers-Satchell volatility, Garman-Klass volatility, and Yang-\nZhang volatility. We discuss the ef\ufb01ciency and bias of each estimator and\nalso how each is perturbed by different aspects of real markets, such as fat\ntails in the return distribution, trends, and microstructure noise. We dis-cuss different frequencies of measurement.\nNext we try to forecast the volatility that will be present over the\nlifetime of the trade. We look at simple moving window forecasts, expo-nentially weighted moving averages, and various members of the GARCH\nfamily. But for trading we need more than a point estimate of future\nvolatility. We need some estimate of the possible range of volatilities sowe can make sensible judgments about the risk/reward characteristics of\nprospective trades. To \ufb01nd this we examine the construction and sampling\nproperties of volatility cones.\nAlthough our focus is to look for situations where implied volatility is\nat variance with our forecast of realized volatility, dynamics of the impliedvolatility surface are also interesting and important. An understanding canhelp our trade execution and timing. In Chapter 3 we look at normal shapes\nof the volatility surface both over time and by strike. We examine implied\n1There are several BSM equations. The differential equation certainly applies to\nAmerican options. The closed-form solutions to this equation, which are also called\nBSM equations, do not.\nint JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:12 Char Count=\nIntroduction 5\nskewness and its sources, including credit, actual skewness of returns, put\nbuying as static hedges, call buying as takeover hedging, and index skew-\nness from implied correlation. We extend the Black-Scholes paradigm to\ninclude skewness and kurtosis and provide several rules of thumb for com-paring volatilities across time and underlying product.\nIn order to pro\ufb01t from our forecast of volatility we need to hedge, so\nthat our risk is actually realized volatility. Hedging removes the risks thatwe do not wish to take. We wish to accept risks that we believe to be mis-\npriced and eliminate or at least mitigate our exposure to other sources of\nrisk. With the simple, exchange-traded options that we generally consider,these unwanted risks are the drift of the underlying and movement in inter-\nest rates. Hedging is costly but it reduces risk. So when exactly should we\nhedge? In Chapter 4 we examine how to optimally solve this risk/rewardissue. We also look at how to aggregate our positions to further reduce the\nneed for hedging.\nOnce our position is hedged, what can we expect to happen? Chapter\n5 examines the pro\ufb01t-and-loss distribution of a discretely hedged positionand shows how this changes depending on the volatility we choose to use\nfor delta estimation and the particular path taken by the underlying.\nThis completes the \ufb01rst stage in the trade process: \ufb01nding a trade with\na positive expectation. Now we need to look at how portfolio managementchoices can affect our success.\nChapter 6 demonstrates how different choices for trade sizing can dra-\nmatically affect returns. We introduce Kelly betting and compare it withother schemes, such as \ufb01xed-sized trading and proportional sizing. We also\nnote how the sizing decisions affect risk by looking at risk of ruin and draw-\ndowns. This is initially done for the simplest possible case, a trade that hasa binary outcome. This is a long way from being even a partially realistic\nmodel of reality, but it is necessary to start with such simple examples,\nas even traders with many years of experience seem to have very little ifany idea of the implications of trade sizing. They obviously are aware that\nit is better to play a game with a positive edge many times so as to take\nadvantage of the law of large numbers, but rarely take their understandingbeyond this level. Futures traders seem to know more about this than op-\ntions traders. Gamblers know even more. Most of the research in this area\nhas been done by gamblers, particularly blackjack players. (Generally, itseems that the more complex the \ufb01nancial product, the less complex is the\nactual trading process, ranging from the very complex blackjack strategy\nand sizing decisions to the trading of structured derivatives, where most of\nthe edge lies in pricing and sales.)\nVolatility trading is not binary in outcome. We need to extend Kelly\nto deal with situations that have a continuum of outcomes. (We really justneed to extend the generally used version of the Kelly criterion. The Kelly\nint JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:12 Char Count=\n6 VOLATILITY TRADING\ncriterion itself is far more general than the version that is often presented).\nFurther, volatility is a mean-reverting processes. We must again extend our\nsizing methodology to account for this and show by simulations how this\nleads to familiar (to market makers) and simple scaling rules.\nWe also present some alternatives to the Kelly paradigm that may be\nmore applicable to trading situations where the long run is of less interestthan the short term. Traders should be aware of these methods. People whoallocate capital to traders should be even more aware of them. Generally\ntraders and trading \ufb01rms will have somewhat different sets of priorities\nhere.\nIn order to distinguish our results from chance we need to keep care-\nful track of the results of our trades. In particular we need to be aware ofmuch more than total pro\ufb01t and loss. This is particularly important in eval-uating the ef\ufb01cacy of a new trade. Chapter 7 examines a number of mea-\nsures including win/loss ratios; drawdowns; Sharpe, Calmar, and Sortino\nratios; and the omega measure. Unfortunately, this type of record keepingand post-trade analysis is often left undone. I believe that this is the most\nimportant aspect of trading, and also the most often overlooked. How can\nyou improve if you don\u2019t really know what your results are?\nPsychology is often mentioned in trading books. But successful trad-\ning is emphatically not due to \u201cbeing con\ufb01dent,\u201d \u201creading the market\u201d or\u201chaving no fear\u201d (although I was recently told that this was why a partic-\nular trader was good). This book does not go into this self-help style of\npsychology. Most of the psychological topics dealt with in books for ama-teurs or semiprofessionals can be addressed by sound money management\nrules and a sensible means of \ufb01nding and measuring edge. However, knowl-\nedge of behavioral \ufb01nance can be useful to even experienced traders. InChapter 8 we look through some of the cognitive and emotional biases op-\ntion traders will most often experience, both from a defensive and offen-\nsive viewpoint: things to watch out for to avoid hurting our own trading,and things to look for in the market that can be pro\ufb01tably exploited. Most\nsources of edge exist because of some behavioral aspect of psychology.\nFinally, we examine one trade in detail, going through its complete life\ncycle from conception to expiration.\nc01 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:2 Char Count=\nCHAPTER 1\nOption Pricing\nIn order to pro\ufb01tably trade options we need a model for valuing them.\nThis is a framework we can use to compare options of different maturi-\nties, underlyings, and strikes. We do not insist that it is in any sense true\nor even a particularly accurate re\ufb02ection of the real world. As options are\nhighly leveraged, nonlinear, time-dependent bets on the underlying, their\nprices change very quickly. The major goal of a pricing model is to trans-late these prices into a more slowly moving system.\nA model that perfectly captures all aspects of a \ufb01nancial market is\nprobably unobtainable. Further, even if it existed it would be too complexto calibrate and use. So we need to somewhat simplify the world in order to\nmodel it. Still, with any model we must be aware of the simplifying assump-\ntions that are being used and the range of applicability. The speci\ufb01c choice\nof model isn\u2019t as important as developing this level of understanding.\nTHE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON MODEL\nWe present here an analysis of the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) equation.\nThe BSM formalism becomes the conceptual framework for an optionstrader: In the same way that we hear our own thoughts in English, an ex-\nperienced derivatives trader thinks in the BSM language.\nThe standard derivation of the BSM equation can be found in any num-\nber of places (for example, Hull 2005). While good derivations carefullylead us through the mathematics and \ufb01nancial assumptions, they don\u2019t\n7\nc01 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:2 Char Count=\n8 VOLATILITY TRADING\ngenerally make it obvious what to do as a trader. We must always remem-\nber that our goal is to identify and pro\ufb01t from mispriced options. How does\nthe BSM formalism help us do this?\nHere we approach the problem backwards. We start from the assump-\ntion that a trader holds a delta hedged portfolio consisting of a call optionand/Delta1units of short stock.\n1We then apply our knowledge of option dy-\nnamics to derive the BSM equation.\nEven before we make any assumptions about the distribution of under-\nlying returns, we can state a number of the properties that an option must\npossess. These should be \ufb01nancially obvious.\nrA call (put) becomes more valuable as the underlying rises (falls), as it\nhas more chance of becoming intrinsically valuable.rAn option loses value as time passes, as it has less time to become\nintrinsically valuable.rAn option loses value as rates increase. Since we have to borrowmoney to pay for options, as rates increase our \ufb01nancing costs in-crease, ignoring for now any rate effects on the underlying.\nrThe value of a call (put) can never be more than the value of the un-derlying (strike).\nAs we have said, even before the invention of the BSM formalism, op-\ntion traders were aware that directional risk could be mitigated by combin-ing their options with a position in the underlying. So let\u2019s assume we holdthe delta hedged option position,\nC\u2212/Delta1S\nt (1.1)\nwhere\nCis the value of the option\nStis the underlying price at time t\n/Delta1is the number of shares we are short\n1That this is a standard delta hedged portfolio should be common knowledge for\noption traders or indeed anyone who has previously seen any sort of derivation of\nBSM. Indeed, traders knew about delta hedging long before BSM. For an interesting\nhistory refer to Haug 2007a. But even if this is the \ufb01rst derivation of BSM the reader\nhas seen, this shouldn\u2019t be seen as a remarkable fact. A call (put) option gains (de-clines) in value as the underlying rises. So in principle we can offset this directional\nrisk with a position in the underlying. This should be obvious. The details of exactly\nhow much of the underlying to hold are certainly not meant to be obvious.\nc01", "doc_id": "885c9b85-4a00-42e3-85df-bdaf1df7ca44", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "495f9249c2e5d695b9a9dc254798b897a4506f8f44647f827aaa97907ebc4371", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 13259, "end": 27607}, "relationships": {"1": "cba938a9-dc3f-413e-8698-8075f9677354", "2": "7447bf44-22c6-4416-a9f8-fcefc998a0b4", "3": "63da6d40-4174-4c3c-ac1d-6f13ea0d3f58"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63da6d40-4174-4c3c-ac1d-6f13ea0d3f58": {"text": "at time t\n/Delta1is the number of shares we are short\n1That this is a standard delta hedged portfolio should be common knowledge for\noption traders or indeed anyone who has previously seen any sort of derivation of\nBSM.

The change in\nthe value of the portfolio is given by the change in the option and stock po-\nsitions together with any \ufb01nancing charges we incur by borrowing money\nto pay for the position.\nC(St+1)\u2212C(St)\u2212/Delta1(St+1\u2212St)+r(C\u2212/Delta1St) (1.2)\nThe last term is written as positive because we know that the value of\nthe long call/short stock portfolio will be negative (or at most zero when/Delta1is 1) and hence will have us lending money and thus receiving interest\nincome. Note also that we assume the time step is small enough that we\ncan take delta to be unchanged.\nThe change in the option value due to the underlying price change can\nbe approximated by a second-order Taylor expansion. Also, we know thatwhen other things are held constant, the option will decrease due to the\npassing of time by an amount denoted by \u03b8.\nSo we get\n/Delta1(S\nt+1\u2212St)+1\n2(St+1\u2212St)2\u22022C\n\u2202S2+\u03b8\u2212/Delta1(St+1\u2212St)+r(C\u2212/Delta1St)\n(1.3)\nOr\n1\n2(St+1\u2212St)2/Gamma1+\u03b8+r(C\u2212/Delta1St) (1.4)\nwhere /Gamma1is the second derivative of the option price with respect to the\nunderlying.\nExpression (1.4) gives the change in value of the portfolio, or the pro\ufb01t\nthe trader makes when the stock price changes by a small amount. It has\nthree separate components:\n1.The \ufb01rst term gives the effect of gamma. Since gamma is positive,\nthe option holder makes money. The return is proportional to half the\nsquare of the underlying price change.\n2.The second term gives the effect of theta. The option holder loses\nmoney due to the passing of time.\n3.The third term gives the effect of \ufb01nancing. Holding a hedged long op-tion portfolio is equivalent to lending money.\nFurther, we see in Chapter 2 that on average\n(S\nt+1\u2212St)2\u223c=\u03c32S2\nc01 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:2 Char Count=\n10 VOLATILITY TRADING\nwhere \u03c3is the standard deviation of the underlying\u2019s returns, generally\nknown as volatility .\nSo we can rewrite expression (1.4) as\n1\n2\u03c32S2/Gamma1+\u03b8+r(C\u2212/Delta1St) (1.5)\nIf we accept that this position should not earn any abnormal pro\ufb01ts\nbecause it is riskless and \ufb01nanced with borrowed money, the expression\ncan be set equal to zero. Therefore the equation for the fair value of theoption is\n1\n2\u03c32S2/Gamma1+\u03b8+r(C\u2212/Delta1St)=0 (1.6)\nBefore continuing, we need to make explicit some of the assumptions thatthis informal derivation has hidden.\nrIn order to write down expression (1.1) we needed to assume the exis-tence of a tradable underlying asset. In fact, we assume that it can be\nshorted and the underlying can be traded in any size necessary without\nincurring transaction costs.\nrExpression (1.2) has assumed that the proceeds from the short sale\ncan be reinvested at the same interest rate at which we have borrowed\nto \ufb01nance the purchase of the call. We have also taken this rate to be\nconstant.rExpression (1.3) has assumed that the underlying changes are continu-\nous and smooth. Further, we have considered second-order derivatives\nwith respect to price but only \ufb01rst-order with respect to time.\nBut something about which we haven\u2019t made any assumptions at all is\nwhether the underlying has any drift. This is remarkable. We may naively\nassume that an instrument whose value increases as the underlying assetrises would be dependent on its drift. However, the effect of drift can be\nnegated by combining the option with the share in the correct proportion.\nAs the drift can be hedged away, the holder of the option is not compen-sated for it. When we consider hedging later in Chapter 4, we \ufb01nd that in\nthe real world, where the assumptions about continuity fail, directional de-\npendence will reemerge.\nHowever, note that while the price change does not appear in equation\n(1.6), the square of the price change does through the volatility term. Sothe magnitude of the price changes is central to whether the trader makesa pro\ufb01t with a delta hedged position. This is true whether or not returns are\nc01 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:2 Char Count=\nOption Pricing 11\nnormally distributed. As long as the variance of returns is \ufb01nite, this result\nholds. In fact, if we had included higher-order price terms in the Taylor\nexpansion, we would see that the option\u2019s price change also depended on\nhigher-order price differences.\nWith appropriate \ufb01nal conditions, equation (1.6) holds for a variety of\ninstruments: European and American options, calls and puts, and manyexotics. It can be solved with any of the usual methods for solving partialdifferential equations.\nIn this exercise we have derived a form of the BSM equation by\nworking backwards from our trader\u2019s knowledge of how options react tochanges in underlying and time. In doing so, it has given us what we need\nto know to trade options from the point of volatility.\nWe have shown how the fair price for an option is related to the stan-\ndard deviation of the underlying returns. Since at any time there is an op-tion market and the underlying market, there are two ways we can pro-\nceed:\n1.Using the quoted price of the option, calculate the implied standard\ndeviation or volatility.\n2.Using an estimate of the volatility over the life of the option, calculatea theoretical option price.\nIf our estimate of volatility differs signi\ufb01cantly from that implied\nby the option market, then we can trade the option accordingly. If we\nforecast volatility to be higher than that implied by the option, we would\nbuy the option and hedge in the underlying market. Our expected pro\ufb01twould depend on the difference between implied volatility and realized\nvolatility. Equation (1.6) says that instantaneously this pro\ufb01t would be\nproportional to\n1\n2S2/Gamma1/parenleftbig\n\u03c32\u2212\u03c32\nimplied/parenrightbig\n(1.7)\nA complementary way to think of the expected pro\ufb01t of a hedged op-\ntion is by considering vega. Vega is de\ufb01ned as the change in value of an op-\ntion if implied volatility changes by one point (e.g., from 19 to 18 percent).\nThis means that if we buy an option at \u03c3implied and volatility immediately\nincreases to \u03c3we would make a pro\ufb01t of\nvega/parenleftbig\n\u03c3\u2212\u03c3implied/parenrightbig\n(1.8)\nIf we have to hold the option to expiration and realized volatility aver-\nages\u03c3we will also make this amount, but only on average. The vega pro\ufb01t\nc01 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:2 Char Count=\n12 VOLATILITY TRADING\nis realized as the sum of the hedges as we rebalance our delta. This can be\nformalized by noting the relationship between vega and gamma,\nvega=\u03c3TS2/Gamma1 (1.9)\nSo expression (1.7) can also be written as\nvega\n\u03c3T/parenleftbig\n\u03c32\u2212\u03c32\nimplied/parenrightbig\n(1.10)\nThe problem this presents is that the gamma is highly dependent on\nthe moneyness of the option, which obviously changes as the underlying\nmoves around. So the pro\ufb01t is highly volatile and path dependent. We ex-\namine this further in Chapter 5.\nIt is perfectly acceptable to make simplifying assumptions when devel-\noping a model. It is totally unacceptable to make assumptions that are soegregiously incorrect that the model is useless, even as a basic guide. Sobefore we go any further we look at how limiting our assumptions really\nare.\nrWe assumed that the underlying was a tradable asset. While the BSM\nformalism has been extended to cases where this is not true, notablyin the pricing of real options, we are primarily concerned with options\non equities and futures, so this assumption is not restrictive. However,\non many optionable underlyings liquidity is an issue, so tradable is not\nalways a clearly de\ufb01ned quality.\nrWe assumed that the underlying pays no dividends or any other in-come. This changes the equations slightly, but the same principles still\napply.\nrWe also assumed this asset was able to be shorted. This is not a prob-\nlem where the underlying is a future but when it is a stock, shorting is\noften more dif\ufb01cult. For example, in the United States, stocks can only\nbe shorted on an uptick. Further, even when shorting is achievable, theshort seller rarely receives the full proceeds of the sale for investment,\nas fees must be paid to borrow the stock. This can be accounted for\nsynthetically by assuming an extra dividend yield on the underlying,equal to the penalty cost associated with shorting the stock.\nrInterest rates have a bid/ask spread. We cannot invest the proceeds ofa sale at the same rate at which we borrow. Further, rates are not con-stant. However, the BSM is often used to price options on bonds and\nmoney market rates which would have no volatility if this assumption\nwas valid. We can get away with this because the risk due to interestcharges (rho) is insubstantial in comparison to other risks, at least for\nshort-dated options.\nc01 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:2 Char Count=\nOption Pricing 13\nrWe have assumed that volatility is a constant, neither a function of\ntime nor of the underlying price. Not only is this untrue but we will be\nactively trying to trade these changes. There are models that explic-\nitly take into account volatility changes. However, we choose to rec-ognize this limitation and learn to use the BSM model anyway. This is\nconsistent with our philosophy of the model as a framework for orga-\nnizing our thoughts rather than as an accurate depiction of reality.\nrWe assumed that volatility is the only parameter needed to specify the\ndistribution of the underlying returns. The mean can be hedged away\nand we have ignored higher-order moments. This is the same as as-suming a normal return distribution or a lognormal price distribution.\nThe fact that this is incorrect leads to the well-known phenomenon of\nthevolatility smile , where implied volatility is a function of strike. In\nessence, implied volatility is the wrong number we put into the wrong\nformula to get the correct option price. This can be recti\ufb01ed in sev-\neral ways. In Chapter 3 we present methods of quantifying the impliedskewness and kurtosis.\nrWe have assumed that the underlying\u2019s changes are continuous so wecan continually adjust our hedge. This is not true. Sometimes the un-derlying has vast jumps. For example, it isn\u2019t uncommon for the shares\nof a biotech company to jump by 70 to 80 percent in one day. Modi\ufb01ca-\ntions have been made to the BSM formalism to price options in these\ncircumstances (Merton 1976), but this isn\u2019t really the point. These\njumps cannot be hedged and the replication strategy fails utterly. Wehave to learn to hedge this risk with other options. This is the concept\nof semistatic hedging that traders need to use in practice.\nThe BSM model is remarkably robust. Most of the assumptions that\nwe need to derive the equation can be loosened without destroying the\nmodel\u2019s utility. But note that we will only use the BSM paradigm as a\npricing method, not a risk control method. It is useful to translate the\nfast-moving option prices into a slow-moving parameter, implied volatil-ity, which can be compared to the estimated realized volatility. But risk\ncontrol must be handled separately. Traders should never think about ex-\ntreme risk in terms of the moments of the Gaussian distribution. Asking,\u201cWhat happens if IBM moves \ufb01ve standard deviations?\u201d is useful only in\nnormal situations (where normal is de\ufb01ned as those times when moves\nare well described by the Gaussian distribution). We must also always be\naware of what happens if IBM drops by 50 percent, despite the fact that this\nhas never happened. Merton argued that these extreme jumps could be di-\nversi\ufb01ed away.

But before we can forecast future volatility, we need\nto be able to measure what it has been in the past. In this chapter we look\nat methods of historical volatility measurement including close-to-close\nvolatility, Parkinson volatility, Rogers-Satchell volatility, Garman-Klassvolatility, and Yang-Zhang volatility. We discuss the ef\ufb01ciency (how quickly\nour estimated value converges to the true value) and bias (whether our\nmethod systematically estimates above or below the true value) of each es-timator and also how each is perturbed by different aspects of real markets\nsuch as fat tails in the return distribution, trends, and microstructure noise.\nWe discuss different frequencies of measurement. Once we understand\nwhat is meant by historical volatility, we can look at its properties. We\ndemonstrate mean reversion, volatility clustering, and seasonality effects.\nDEFINING AND MEASURING VOLATILITY\nFor trading we need more than a point estimate of future volatility; weneed some estimate of possible range of volatilities. To \ufb01nd this we exam-\nine the construction and sampling properties of volatility cones. Measuring\nvolatility and having a forecast of its distribution are essential for success-fully trading options. Sadly, it is not suf\ufb01cient. Buying volatility because it\nis cheap or selling because it is rich is seldom a good idea. Often things\n15\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n16 VOLATILITY TRADING\nwill be cheap for a reason. Any forecast we make has to be supplemented\nby our fundamental analysis (e.g., what catalyst will appear to cause the\nvolatility to rise? or what are we hoping will not happen if we are short?).\nThe markets are very complex and interrelated, and all measurements andforecasts must be placed in the context of the current trading environment.\nMeasuring volatility is not like measuring price. Instantaneous volatil-\nity is unobservable. It needs time to manifest itself. Measuring it is some-thing of an art form and we need to choose between various statistical\nestimators. In fact, Poon (2005) lists over 100 references on volatility fore-\ncasting, which gives some idea of the dif\ufb01culty of the problem. We do notattempt to \ufb01nd a de\ufb01nitive answer here. Instead, we look at a number of\ndifferent estimators, learn their strengths and de\ufb01ciencies, and determine\nwhere each should best be applied.\nDEFINITION OF VOLATILITY\nThe standard de\ufb01nition of volatility is the square root of the variance. Andvariance is de\ufb01ned as\ns\n2=1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=1(xi\u2212\u00afx)2(2.1a)\nwhere\n(for our purposes) xiare the logarithmic returns\n\u00afxis the mean return in the sample\nNis the sample size\nTo express the variance in annualized terms, we would need to multi-\nply the raw variance by the annualization factor given by N, the number of\ntrading periods in a year\u2014for example, 252 if using daily data, as this is thenumber of trading days in a year (at least in the United States).\nIf the historical price series includes the payment of a dividend (or a\nstock split), we must adjust the price series. The effect of a stock goingex-dividend makes it look like there was volatility even though therewas none. If this adjustment is not done, our volatility estimate may\nwell be wrong by several percentage points. For example, if we have a 3\npercent price drop due to the stock going ex-dividend, it looks like a 48percent move on an annualized basis (i.e., 0 .03\u221a\n252). Obviously this is\nvery signi\ufb01cant.\nThere are several different ways of making this adjustment. The \ufb01rst\nis simply to subtract the dividend from the price before the ex-dividend\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\nVolatility Measurement and Forecasting 17\ndate. This leaves the absolute values of the day-to-day changes before the\nex-dividend date unchanged, but if we have enough dividends in the series\nthis process can lead to apparently negative stock prices.\nA better method is to multiply by an adjustment factor that leaves the\npercentage changes unaffected. This factor is\n1\u2212dividend\nprice(2.1a)\nPrices before the ex-dividend date are multiplied by this factor. This\nisbackward adjustment . Alternatively, it is possible to forward-adjust\nprices, which would mean that the current price won\u2019t be the same as the\nadjusted price.\nIn \ufb01nance it is very dif\ufb01cult to distinguish mean returns (drift) from\nvariance (this is a central problem in many arguments about trading meth-ods and results), and estimates of the mean return are notoriously noisy,\nespecially for small samples. So we generally set the mean return in equa-\ntion (2.1a) to zero. This increases accuracy of measurement by removing a\nsource of noise.\ns\n2=1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=1(xi)2(2.1b)\nEquations (2.1a) and (2.1b) make no assumptions about the distribu-\ntion, other than that the sum converges. All \ufb01nite samples have variance.\nHowever, to use volatility for pricing options, we need to make assump-\ntions about the process generating the returns. As mentioned in Chapter\n1, the BSM model assumed that the returns were normally distributed. Inthis case variance completely characterizes the shape of the distribution.\nWe know this isn\u2019t true, but we still expect variance (and hence volatil-\nity) to be a very important parameter, indeed the dominant parameter, fordescribing the width of the return distribution.\nTo estimate the population variance from this sample variance we need\nto make the conversion (Kenny and Keeping 1951):\n\u03c3\n2=N\nN\u22121s2(2.2)\nUnfortunately, some authorities choose to avoid this step by directly\nde\ufb01ning the sample variance to be\ns2=1\nN\u22121N/summationdisplay\ni=1(xi\u2212\u00afx)2(2.3)\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n18 VOLATILITY TRADING\nso that is already an unbiased estimator for the population variance. It is\nvery important to know exactly which de\ufb01nition you are dealing with, and\nthis seems to be a recurring source of confusion. Always check for the\n(N\u22121) factor in the denominator. The Microsoft Excel function VAR uses\nthis second convention.\nEquations (2.2) and (2.3) give unbiased estimates of variance, but sim-\nply taking the square root will give an estimate of volatility that is biasedlow. This is because of Jensen\u2019s inequality, which states that the average of\na square root is always less than the square root of the average.

If we use too little data\nwe will have a noisy measurement of volatility that, due to sampling er-ror, might not be close to the true volatility; but if we use too much data\nwe will be using information that is no longer relevant to the current state\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\nVolatility Measurement and Forecasting 21\nTABLE 2.2 Con\ufb01dence Interval as a Function of Sample Size N\nSample Size True Volatility Standard Deviation Approx.

Choosing the right compromise is something of an art, and\nthe most appropriate solution will be dependent on current market condi-\ntions. However, it is obvious that the commonly used method of measuringvolatility from the last 30 closing prices gives an unacceptably large sam-\npling error. The 95 percent con\ufb01dence interval of two standard deviations\nmeans that we could be off by as much as 25 percent of the true value!\nSampling error is not the same as measurement error. In a physics ex-\nperiment we might only be able to measure a certain quantity to a limiteddegree of precision, due to the limitations of the measuring device or theexperimental setup. But if we ignore the bid/ask spread, the price of a stock\nis an exact number. So the historical volatility is an exact number. There is\nno uncertainty due to measurement. But there is uncertainty over whetherthe measure number is truly representative of the underlying reality. The\nsituation has an analogy in baseball. When a player goes \ufb01ve for \ufb01ve he did\nhit 1.000. That is beyond dispute. But no one would claim he is truly a 1.000hitter. We have just been lucky enough to see the portion of his career when\nhe hit well. There will be other days when he goes hitless. Similarly we need\nto remember that, like hitting ability, volatility is an unobservable quantity\nthat we can only estimate. Our measurements are distorted re\ufb02ections of\nthe true volatility in the same way that a handful of plate appearances canonly give a partial picture of a baseball player\u2019s true ability.\nBefore addressing this, let\u2019s note that another reason the close-to-close\nestimator is useful is because it can be rewritten in a form that allows us toeasily relate typical average stock moves to volatility, which is very useful\nfor traders.\nThe de\ufb01nition of the standard deviation involves the square root of an\naverage of squares, and we typically don\u2019t", "doc_id": "e807bbf8-e484-4ef5-8c24-6cad88c9902d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c451813d3ce8fcfe1b4d85250059ee0ceef631c8990f2cd4d82889318ced0d48", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 41070, "end": 53824}, "relationships": {"1": "cba938a9-dc3f-413e-8698-8075f9677354", "2": "63da6d40-4174-4c3c-ac1d-6f13ea0d3f58", "3": "fbbf31ba-84cb-41c5-870e-fb42078451d9"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbbf31ba-84cb-41c5-870e-fb42078451d9": {"text": "the portion of his career when\nhe hit well.

We can use the close-to-close estimator with higher-frequencydata, or we can use another estimator that doesn\u2019t throw away all data\npoints other than closing prices. Each has limitations. First we will try to\ndevelop better estimators, an approach that is also more generally applica-ble. If we can \ufb01nd a better estimator we could always apply it to higher-\nfrequency data.\nALTERNATIVE VOLATILITY ESTIMATORS\nThe \ufb01rst such estimator was developed by Parkinson (Parkinson 1980). His\nestimator is\n\u03c3=/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt 1\n4Nln 2N/summationdisplay\ni=1/parenleftbigg\nlnhi\nli/parenrightbigg2\n(2.14)\nwhere\nhiis the high price in the trading period\nliis the low price\nAs before, this would need to be annualized by multiplying it by the\nsquare root of the number of trading periods in a year. It makes sense that\nthe range could give an estimate of volatility. That is generally what traders\nperceive volatility to be. It also seems likely that this estimate would needfewer time periods to converge to the true volatility as it uses two prices\nfrom each period, instead of just one as with the close-to-close estimator.\nThis is true. The Parkinson estimator is about \ufb01ve times more ef\ufb01cient atestimating volatility than the close-to-close estimator when it is tested on\nan arti\ufb01cially generated geometric Brownian motion (GBM). ( Ef\ufb01ciency is\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\nVolatility Measurement and Forecasting 23\nTABLE 2.3Sampling Error in\nParkinson Variance\nSample Size Parkinson Variance/\nTrue Variance\n50 .55\n10 0.65\n20 0.74\n50 0.82\n100 0.86\n200 0.92\nde\ufb01ned as the ratio of the variance of the close-to-close estimator to the\nrange-based estimator).\nIf prices are continuous, the Parkinson estimate of variance is unbiased\n(but remember that there is a bias introduced by Jensen\u2019s inequality whenwe convert any variance estimate to a volatility estimate). However, prices\nare only sampled discretely. This is true both because markets only trade\nin discrete units and, more important, because markets are only open for\npart of the day. This means that the unobservable true price may not makea high or a low when we can actually measure it. So we will systematically\nunderestimate volatility by using an estimator based on the observed range.\nGarman and Klass (Garman and Klass 1980) showed by simulation the\nunderestimation due to discrete sampling as a function of sample size, asshown in Table 2.3.\nThe fact that this biases the estimates of volatility low comes as a sur-\nprise to some. There is a pervasive misunderstanding that the Parkinson es-timator is biased high, as it is impossible to actually trade at the extremes.\nThis is true but irrelevant. Parkinson makes no claims about being ableto trade at the extremes of the range, just that the range is related to the\nvolatility. It is an estimator of volatility, not of tradability.\nThis bias is clearly a signi\ufb01cant issue. As a practical matter, the vari-\nance estimate can be unbiased by dividing by these correction factors aswe did in the case of the close-to-close estimator. But this does not address\nthe fact that opening jumps exist in the price series.\nThe other well-known volatility estimator was developed by Garman\nand Klass. It is\n\u03c3=/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt\n1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=11\n2/parenleftbigg\nlnhi\nli/parenrightbigg2\n\u22121\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=1(2l n2\u22121)/parenleftbigg\nlnci\nci\u22121/parenrightbigg2\n(2.15)\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n24 VOLATILITY TRADING\nTABLE 2.4 Sampling Error in Garman-Klass Variance\nSample Size Garman-Klass Variance/\nTrue Variance\n50 .38\n10 0.51\n20 0.64\n50 0.73\n100 0.80\n200 0.85\nThis estimator is up to eight times as ef\ufb01cient as the close-to-close esti-\nmator (the exact ef\ufb01ciency improvement is dependent on the sample size)\nbut is also biased due to the discrete sampling leading to a low estimate of\nthe range. Its bias is actually worse than the Parkinson estimator, as shown\nin Table 2.4 (also from Garman and Klass 1980).\nIf we know what the bias is, it can be corrected. More problemati-\ncally, the studies that show improved ef\ufb01ciency of these estimators rely onassumptions that do not apply to real markets. In particular they as-\nsume that the underlying follows a driftless GBM and trades continuously.\nRogers, Satchell, and Yoon (Rogers and Satchell 1991; Rogers, Satchell,and Yoon 1994) relax this restriction and introduce an estimator that out-\nperforms the others when a drift term is introduced:\n\u03c3=/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt\n1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=1/parenleftbigg\nlnhi\nci/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg\nlnhi\noi/parenrightbigg\n+/parenleftbigg\nlnli\nci/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg\nlnli\noi/parenrightbigg\n(2.16)\nMore recently, Yang and Zhang (2000) derive an estimator that also al-\nlows for opening jumps. It is basically a weighted average of the Rogers,\nSatchell, and Yoon estimator, the close-to-open volatility, and the open-to-\nclose volatility. In some simulations it can have ef\ufb01ciency 14 times greaterthan the close-to-close volatility. But this is highly dependent on the pro-\nportion of volatility caused by opening jumps. If these jumps dominate, the\nestimator performs no better than the close-to-close estimator.

This should not be a surprise as both are dependent on ex-\ntreme prices and continuity was still assumed.\nAt this point we have \ufb01ve estimators, each constructed to address a\nshortcoming of the last. So each iteration should be better. Is our choiceof which estimator to use obvious? Not really. When Brandt and Kinlay\nperformed tests on more realistic simulated data (discretely sampled, with\ndrift and jumps), the differences between the estimators became less dis-tinct. Under these circumstances the Garman-Klass and Yang-Zhang es-\ntimators are biased slightly high and all of the nonclassical estimators\nhave similar ef\ufb01ciencies. Further, the correlation between the estimatorsis much higher when tested on real market data than on simulated data\n(correlations are shown in Table 2.5 and Table 2.6).\nThe overall conclusion we need to draw is that there really is no in-\ndication that any one estimator is best.

For example, if the Parkinsonvolatility is 40 percent and the close-to-close volatility is 20 percent, we\ncan reasonably conclude that much of the true volatility is being driven by\nlarge intraday ranges and that the closing prices underrepresent the truevolatility of the process. This is useful knowledge when deciding how best\nto hedge. (Actually, it would have been useful knowledge.

It seems likely that this willbecome less of an issue in the future.\nAs we sample at higher frequencies we generally improve the qual-\nity of our measurement because we have increased the number of datapoints in our sample without increasing the calendar time we are measur-\ning over. However, as we go to very high frequencies (exactly what this\nmeans is product speci\ufb01c, but we generally mean time intervals of a minuteor less) we lose the ability to know what the true price actually is. Con-\nsider for example, a stock that has a true volatility of 30 percent. Using 15-\nminute prices, a 0.1 percent bid/ask spread can change our measurementby about 2 percent due to our taking a noisy estimate of the true underly-\ning price as our input. The true price could be up to 0.1 percent away from\nour actual observation. This problem becomes more acute as we increasethe sampling frequency. Finding optimal sampling frequencies in the pres-\nence of microstructure noise was addressed by Ait-Sahalia et al. (2005),\nbut the econometric techniques necessary and the data storage requiredprobably put such methods out of the reach of most option traders for the\nnear future.\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\nVolatility Measurement and Forecasting 29\nTo avoid these issues we need to choose a sampling period that is large\ncompared to the typical trade time. This will vary from product to product,\nbut 15 to 30 minutes should be a good place to start.\nWhen analyzing daily returns, seasonality is not really a huge issue.\nThere is some evidence that stock volatilities are lower on Fridays andhigher on Mondays but the differences are very small. However, there are\ntwo very important seasonal effects in high-frequency data that we need tobe aware of.\nThe \ufb01rst is that the overnight return needs to be accounted for. In the\nUnited States, equities trade on the exchanges for six and a half hours. Sothe overnight return could clearly be very different in magnitude. It is also\nvery different in character. Most relevant news occurs during the trading\nday, and a signi\ufb01cant amount of volatility is driven by trading volume, prac-tically all of which occurs during public trading periods.\nFirst we just ignore the overnight return and take the \ufb01rst return of the\nday to be\nx\n0=ln/parenleftbiggSopen\nSclose\u22121/parenrightbigg\n(2.18)\ninstead of\nx0=ln/parenleftbiggSclose\nSclose\u22121/parenrightbigg\n(2.19)\nAll other returns are calculated in the normal way. Now we just es-\ntimate volatility as before and annualize the result with the appropriatefactor (for example, there are 13 half-hour periods in a trading day, so wewould multiply the result by the square root of 13 times 252 U.S. trading\ndays per year).\nNext we need to determine the amount of total variance that occurs\nduring the trading day. This can be estimated by calculating the normalclose-to-close volatility from daily data and comparing this with the volatil-\nity calculated using the returns from the daily open to the daily close. Formost American stocks, about 85 percent of the total volatility is due to ac-\ntivity that occurs during the trading day (indexes are higher at around 90\npercent and ADRs are lower at around 60 to 70 percent). If we divide theraw volatility estimate by this factor we obtain the opening jump\u2013adjusted,\nhigh-frequency volatility estimator. The great advantage of using more data\nin this way is that a given time period contains more data points and thusleads to a smaller sampling error. While using the past 250 trading days\nto estimate current volatility seems somewhat inappropriate, 250 half-hour\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n30 VOLATILITY TRADING\n00.050.10.150.20.250.3\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nCentral Standard TimeMSFT Volatility\nFIGURE 2.4 MSFT Intraday Volatility\ntrading periods spans only 20 trading days. Assuming that the true process\nis stationary over such a period is far less optimistic.\nThe other aspect of seasonality to keep in mind is that the true volatil-\nity varies wildly throughout the trading day, and the variation is rather pre-dictable. Figures 2.4 through 2.6 show the intraday volatility calculated asthe average of the Parkinson volatility of 30-minute returns for the time\nperiod from April 23 to June 4, 2007. We show the pattern for Microsoft\n(MSFT), Citigroup (C), and Genentech (DNA). Each shows a similar pat-tern in which volatility peaks at the open, dies down during the day, and\nhas a small resurgence toward the close. This pattern has also been docu-\nmented in currencies, bonds, and equity indexes (Lequex 1999).\n00.050.10.150.20.250.3\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nCentral Standard TimeC Volatility\nFIGURE 2.5 C Intraday Volatility\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\nVolatility Measurement and Forecasting 31\n00.050.10.150.20.25\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nCentral Standard TimeDNA Volatility\nFIGURE 2.6 DNA Intraday Volatility\nThis is interesting, but when we trade options we are really interested\nin the average volatility over a long period (known as integrated volatility\nin the econometric literature).

This topic is well beyondthe scope of this book. Those interested could start with Gencay et al.(2001) or Lequex (1999).\nFORECASTING VOLATILITY\nNow that we have seen how to measure what volatility currently is, weneed to forecast what it will be over the lifetime of the option. This will ob-viously be more dif\ufb01cult. Before we start applying any mathematics, let\u2019s\nlook at some of the characteristics of what we are trying to forecast. How\ndoes volatility behave? Figure 2.7 shows the volatility of the S&P 500 esti-mated using a rolling 50-day window from the start of 1990 until the end of\nJuly 2007.\nWe have to be a little careful here that statements we make are about\nthe actual volatility and are not about artifacts of the measurement process.But there are some things that seem fairly evident.\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n32 VOLATILITY TRADING\n00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.450.5\n3/14/90\n3/14/913/14/923/14/93\n3/14/94\n3/14/953/14/963/14/97\n3/14/98\n3/14/993/14/00\n3/14/01\n3/14/02\n3/14/03\n3/14/04\n3/14/05\n3/14/06\n3/14/07Volatility\nFIGURE 2.7 S&P 500 Volatility (Together with Its Average Value)\nrThe volatility of the volatility is positively related to the level.rThere are more large moves up than down.rIt seems to be, locally at least, mean-reverting, it is pulled towards its\nlong-term mean (this is discussed in more depth in Chapter 3).\nThese general features need to be kept in mind as we try to make\nvolatility forecasts.\nThe simplest forecasting method is just to assume that the next Ndays\nwill be like the past N. So if we have measured the volatility (using what-\never estimator) over the past 30 days to be 20 percent, we will use thisas our forecast for the next 30. This is sometimes known as the moving\nwindow method. The obvious problem with this forecast is that a big move\nin the stock\u2019s price, say a jump due to good earnings, will stay in the volatil-\nity estimate for Ndays and then drop out abruptly. This effect is shown in\nFigure 2.8.\nClearly the volatility forecast after the jump should not be 100 per-\ncent. The jump, a huge event, has already happened and is very atypical.Obviously it is biasing the forecast. (Note that it is not biasing the esti-\nmate of current volatility. Volatility over the previous 30 days was indeed100 percent). A standard way to address this is to use the exponentiallyweighted moving average model. This takes the form\n\u03c3\n2\nt=\u03bb\u03c32\nt\u22121+(1\u2212\u03bb)r2(2.20)\nwhere \u03bbis a parameter between zero and one.\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\nVolatility Measurement and Forecasting 33\n00.20.40.60.811.2\nDate30-Day Volatility\n6/20/06\n7/4/06\n7/18/06\n8/15/068/1/06\n8/29/06\n9/12/069/26/06\n10/10/0610/24/06\n11/7/06\n11/21/06\n12/5/06\n12/19/06\n1/2/07\n1/16/071/30/072/13/072/27/073/13/073/27/074/10/074/24/07\nFIGURE 2.8 The 30-Day Moving Window Close-to-Close Volatility for True Reli-\ngion Apparel Inc. (TRLG) between June 20, 2006, and May 7, 2007\nThis models the variance as a weighted average between the most re-\ncent squared returns and the previous variance. (We have used the vari-\nance form here because it is normally stated in this way, as are the later\ntime-series models we look at.) A lower value of \u03bbmeans less emphasis is\nplaced on the more distant past and more on the most recent observation.Generally values of between 0.9 and 0.99 are used.\nThis method has the virtues of being simple to use and understand. It\nhas the drawback of being a stupid solution. If the event truly was an outlierwe would be better off excluding it from our data set when we forecast\nwhat volatility will be in the future. An exponential weighting may smooththe jumps in our volatility forecast but it does so purely to make things look\npretty: A better solution is for the trader to decide if the event really was an\noutlier and, if it was, to then exclude it, or to treat it as a somewhat specialcase that could occur again and weight its contribution accordingly. To\npostulate that its effect decays exponentially really just dodges the issue.\nFor example, a jump due to earnings is clearly an abnormal event. It\nwould be good trading practice to exclude this from future forecasts (un-less they include future earnings dates). Why would it make sense to use an\nexponential decay? The earnings announcement was a single event. Therewon\u2019t be a lesser earnings announcement the next day as well, and an even\nsmaller one the day after that.\nA further problem with this method is that it doesn\u2019t take into account\nthe context of the most recent measurement. Both casual examination(look at Figure 2.7) and careful statistical analysis show that volatility is\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n34 VOLATILITY TRADING\na mean-reverting process; high volatility is likely to be followed by periods\nof lower volatility and vice versa. The exponentially weighted moving aver-\nage (EWMA) forecast ignores this. The forecast variance tomorrow is the\nsame as the forecast variance for the day after and for all days after that.\nThe famous generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedasticity\n(GARCH) family of models addresses this by adding a long-term averagevariance that we expect variance to revert to, so that if variance is currentlyhigh we may expect it to stay high in the near term (as in the EWMA model)\nbut to eventually revert to normality. The GARCH(1,1) model is\n\u03c3\n2\nt=\u03b3V+\u03b1r2\nt\u22121+\u03b2\u03c32\nt\u22121 (2.21)\nwhere Vis the long-term variance.\nClearly we must have\n\u03b3+\u03b1+\u03b2=1 (2.22)\nAnd when \u03b3=0,\u03b1=1\u2212\u03bb, and \u03b2=\u03bb, we recover the EWMA model\nas a special case. Generally this model is written in the form\n\u03c32\nt=\u03c9+\u03b1r2\nt\u22121+\u03b2\u03c32\nt\u22121 (2.23)\nThis is a more convenient form to use when estimating the parameters\nbut it is used at the expense of a nice interpretation for the meaning of the\n\ufb01rst term. Now the long-term variance is given by\nV=\u03c9\n1\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2(2.24)\nInstead of having dependence on only the \ufb01rst lagged returns and vari-\nances it is possible to further generalize the model to include the past p\nreturns and the past qvariances. This results in the GARCH( p,q) model.\n\u03c32\nt=\u03c9+\u03b11r2\nt\u22121+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ \u03b1pr2\nt\u2212p+\u03b21\u03c32\nt\u22121+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03b2q\u03c32\nt\u2212q (2.25)\nTo use GARCH to forecast volatility, we approach the subject itera-\ntively.

We could also do this for GARCH and\narbitrarily set values for the parameters. However, those who believe the\nvariance process is described by a GARCH model generally do not do this,\nrelying instead on maximum likelihood estimation to \ufb01nd the parameters\nfor each underlying. (This is one of the often-stated objections to GARCH:that it is subject to retrospective curve \ufb01tting of the parameters. More cor-\nrectly, this is a possible problem with the common implementation of the\nmodel rather than with the model itself.)\nMaximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method for estimating\nthe parameters of a probability distribution. Likelihood differs fromprobability. Probability refers to the chance that a future event occurs,whereas likelihood refers to past events. In MLE the parameters are cho-\nsen to maximize the probability of the \ufb01nal observed outcome actually\nhappening.\nA commonly cited example is estimating the number of cabs in a city.\nAll we know is that all cabs are given a unique number and that numbersare consecutively issued, with no numbers being skipped. If the \ufb01rst cab\nwe see has number 2028, what is our MLE estimate? Clearly there can be\nno fewer than 2028 cabs. Recall that MLE looks to \ufb01nd the parameter thatmakes the observation most likely. In this case if there were exactly 2,028\ncabs in the city our chances of spotting that particular car would be 1/2,028.\nIf there were any more cars than this we would have had a smaller chanceof seeing exactly that one. So the MLE estimate is 2,028. Note that although\nthis is our best estimate, it could be a long way from the actual number.\nThere could well be 10,000 cabs. But MLE makes the best use of the infor-mation available to us.\nThe next example is less trivial, although still somewhat contrived.\nLet\u2019s assume that we toss a coin 10 times. We don\u2019t know whether it is afair coin\u2014in fact, it could be one of three coins. One coin comes up heads\none-third of the time, another gives heads half of the time, and the third\nyields heads two-thirds of the time. If we get six heads in our experiment,what coin is it most likely that we were using?\nLetpbe the (unknown) probability of throwing a head. So the prob-\nability of getting a tail is 1 \u2212p.

The solver algorithm is likely to have dif\ufb01culties \ufb01tting a\nmodel, as there will be very small changes in the likelihood for a wide range\nof parameters. This can be somewhat addressed by using variance target-ing, where the omega term is set equal to the unconditional variance of the\nsample multiplied by (1 \u2013 \u03b1\u2013\u03b2), and we only vary the alpha and beta terms.\nStill, it may be necessary to use more sophisticated numerical tech-\nniques if we want to use GARCH models extensively. These could also pro-vide statistics giving the goodness of \ufb01t of the model. There are a number\nof reasons why the model may not \ufb01t the data well. These include:\nrInsuf\ufb01cient data. Generally at least 1,000 data points are required.rPoor initial values for the parameters.\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n38 VOLATILITY TRADING\nrPersistent seasonality contained in the data. This is a particular prob-\nlem with intraday data.rWrong model. The data just isn\u2019t consistent with the model chosen!\nEconometricians have developed a large number of models to address\nthis last issue. I list some of the more common models here, but this list\nis far from exhaustive. In fact, since the original work by Engle (1982),\nan enormous number of versions have been developed.1One paper docu-\nments a comparative test of 330 models (Hansen and Lunde 2005).\nrExponential GARCH (EGARCH) models the log of the variance. Thismeans it can incorporate asymmetry, as negative shocks can have a\ndifferent effect to positive shocks (Nelson 1991).\nrGJR-GARCH is another asymmetric model where an extra term is\npresent in the case of downward shocks (Glosten et al. 1993).rIntegrated GARCH (IGARCH) further constrains the parameters sothat alpha and beta sum to one.\nrThreshold GARCH (TGARCH) has an extra term that applies when\nshocks are negative, again allowing asymmetry.rAbsolute Value GARCH (AGARCH) directly models volatility instead\nof variance (Taylor 1986; Schwert 1989).rComponent GARCH (CGARCH) models the variance as the sum of sev-eral processes or components. One could be used to capture the short-\nterm response to shock and another to capture the long-term response.\nThis allows the model to capture long memory effects (Engle and Lee1999; Ding and Granger 1996).\nIt certainly seems that GARCH does capture some elements of the\ntime evolution of variance. Further, it can be motivated by a fairly sim-ple microstructure-based argument (Sato and Takayasu 2002). However,\nthe fact that so many models exist in the family, with no one being de\ufb01ni-\ntively superior, can certainly be seen as a negative. Also, if we estimatethe parameters of the model using MLE, then reestimate the model at a\nlater date, we \ufb01nd little persistence in the values of the parameters. This\nwould also seem to indicate that the model was not a particularly good\ndescription of reality. Also note that this model is meant to be predictive,\nnot just descriptive. Unlike BSM, which is just a conceptual framework, avolatility forecast really does need to have good correspondence with the\nfuture.\n1Engle actually developed ARCH. The GARCH model was \ufb01rst proposed by Boller-\nslev (1986). ARCH is GARCH(0,1).\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\nVolatility Measurement and Forecasting 39\nFORECASTING THE VOLATILITY\nDISTRIBUTION\nIn addition to the GARCH family, there are many other methods for pre-\ndicting time series. These include neural networks, genetic algorithms, andclassical econometric methods such as the ARMA family of models. We\ndon\u2019t touch on these here for several reasons: I have seen no conclusive ev-\nidence that they are any good at predicting; genetic algorithms and neural\nnets are very specialized methods that are easy to misuse; and while time\nseries analysis is probably a good thing to know (refer to Taylor 1986), it isdoubtful that spending a great deal of time trying to re\ufb01ne a point forecast\nis worth it.\nEven if we agree with the Nobel Prize committee that the GARCH\n\u201cmodels have become indispensible tools not only for researchers, butalso for analysts on \ufb01nancial markets, who use them in asset pricing and\nin evaluating portfolio risk,\u201d\n2it isn\u2019t actually the breakthrough that an\noption trader needs. A point forecast of volatility just isn\u2019t all that use-\nful. We need a forecast of the volatility distribution . Selling one-month\nimplied volatility at 15 percent might seem like a good idea if we have a\nforecast of 12 percent. It will seem less like a good idea if we know that\none-month realized volatility has had a range of 11 to 35 percent. It isn\u2019t\njust the forecast that is necessary. It is putting the forecast into the contextof a volatility range. A simple way to do this is through the use of volatility\ncones.\nAs stated in the seminal paper on the subject (Burghart and Lane 1990),\n\u201cThe purpose of a volatility cone is to illustrate the ranges of volatility ex-perience for different trading horizons.\u201d Let\u2019s look at the example of MSFTvolatility for the four years ending April 30, 2007. We calculate volatility\n(here we use the close-to-close estimator but there is no reason another\nestimator could not be used) over nonoverlapping periods of 20 tradingdays, 40 trading days, 60 trading days, 120 trading days, and 240 trad-\ning days. These correspond closely to one calendar month, two months,\nthree months, six months, and one year. The results are displayed inFigure 2.10.\nWhen displayed graphically, we can see why this method was called\na volatility cone. The cone shows the tendency for short-term volatilitiesto \ufb02uctuate more widely than longer-dated volatilities. On the one hand\nthis is obvious, as big moves will be averaged away in the longer term. On\nthe other hand, we also know that volatility measurements are prone to\n2From the press release accompanying the announcement of the 2003 prize for eco-\nnomics, http://nobelprize.org/nobel prizes/economics/laureates/2003/press.html\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n40 VOLATILITY TRADING\n00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.450.5\n20 40 60 120 240\nTime (Days)Volatility\nFIGURE 2.10 The Volatility Cone for MSFT, Generated from the Four Years of\nClosing Prices Ending on April 30, 2007\nsampling error, and this more dramatically affects shorter measurement\nperiods (refer back to Table 2.2, where we saw how sampling error is\ndependent on sample size). Further, in order to gain the most information\nfrom a given price series, it would generally be necessary to use overlap-ping data. This clearly will induce an arti\ufb01cial degree of correlation in the\nestimates of volatility and will bias our results somewhat.\nWe need to take all of this into account. Speci\ufb01cally, we need to know\nhow much bias is introduced into our volatility estimates by using overlap-ping data. This problem was studied extensively by Hodges and Tompkins\n(2002). They \ufb01nd that variance measured from overlapping return seriesneed to be multiplied by the adjustment factor\nm=1\n1\u2212h\nn+h2\u22121\n3n2(2.35)\nwhere\nhis the length of each subseries (for example, 20 days)\nn=(T\u2212h)+1 is the number of distinct subseries available for a\ntotal number of observations T\nSo for the example given in Table 2.7, where we need to adjust the\nvariance measured over 60-day subperiods from 1,006 data points, theadjustment factor would be 1.06, or approximately 1.03 when applied tothe volatility. Using this adjustment factor means we can use rolling win-\ndows for estimating volatility, which makes volatility cones a very useful\ntrading tool.\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\nVolatility Measurement and Forecasting 41\nTABLE 2.7The Volatility Cone Numbers for MSFT, Generated from the", "doc_id": "e892f4e7-dd40-40e4-b579-e222280ba948", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9a16401b04c44ca7382faf3f44f9141596f96404195ca78c1c0ea73f536c835e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 79580, "end": 92443}, "relationships": {"1": "cba938a9-dc3f-413e-8698-8075f9677354", "2": "d70f7f66-c038-4f0a-a5c0-b526af82c183", "3": "e3275fc7-cb69-4fb9-9d7b-6ecc31505319"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3275fc7-cb69-4fb9-9d7b-6ecc31505319": {"text": "the length of each subseries (for example, 20 days)\nn=(T\u2212h)+1 is the number of distinct subseries available for a\ntotal number of observations T\nSo for the example given in Table 2.7, where we need to adjust the\nvariance measured over 60-day subperiods from 1,006 data points, theadjustment factor would be 1.06, or approximately 1.03 when applied tothe volatility.

Selling\none-month implied volatility at 35 percent because this is in the 90thper-\ncentile for one-month volatility over the past two years can form the basis\nof a sensible trading plan. Selling 35 percent because GARCH is forecasting\nthe realized volatility to be 20 percent is less sensible. The point forecast\nisn\u2019t as important as the possible distribution of results.\nObviously, it is also possible to construct volatility cones from the\nother volatility estimators.\nThe volatility cone is very useful for placing current market informa-\ntion (realized volatility, implied volatility, and the spread between them)\ninto historical context. But it doesn\u2019t place it in the context of the current\noverall market. This is also something to monitor. If we had a choice of sell-ing Citigroup\u2019s implied volatility at 39 percent when realized is 26 percent,\nor selling the S&P 500 implied volatility at 24 percent when its realized was\n18 percent, we should think carefully. We are not getting much more edgeas a percentage for selling the single stock than we are for the index. Con-\nsider using the implied/realized spread of the index as a benchmark for the\namount of edge you look for in all of your trades. Things change, and thiscontext is always very important.\nVolatility cones are often not very helpful to market makers or other\nvery active traders. In fact, they can be very irritating. This is because\nwhenever the volatility cone tells you that implied volatility is historically\nhigh, you will already be short it. Generally you will have been selling it allthe way up, and will now be sitting on a losing position. But at least you\nwill now know that implied volatility is at all-time high, and now might not\nbe the best time to cover. Market makers will lose money in these types ofsituations anyway. Ignorance can\u2019t help.\nWhen making forecasts we will generally \ufb01nd that the implied volatil-\nity is equal to or signi\ufb01cantly above our forecast volatility. The BSM\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n42 VOLATILITY TRADING\nimplied volatility is in general an upwardly biased estimate. For example, it\nis not uncommon for our forecasts to be 30 percent below current implied\nvolatilities, but we practically never see the converse. There are a number\nof obvious reasons for this:\nrBy selling implied volatility we are selling insurance. Thus there is arisk premium associated with it.\nrPerfectly reasonable things could happen that have never happenedbefore. These will not be taken into account if we only base our fore-\ncast on past data.\nrMarket microstructure encourages implied volatility to be biased high.\nMarket makers make the bulk of their money by collecting the bid/ask\nspread in the options. They will willingly bias their quotes a little too\nhigh to protect their business. In essence, they are buying insurance(slight long volatility exposure, particularly on the downside), as any\nprudent business owner will do.\nThe incorrect conclusion to draw from this discussion is that we can\nalways pro\ufb01t by selling implied volatility. Remember that insurance com-panies pro\ufb01t largely from the pro\ufb01ts made by reinvesting the insurance\npremium. This opportunity isn\u2019t available to option traders using borrowedfunds. The option insurance premium alone isn\u2019t a good enough reason to\nsell options. But we need to acknowledge its existence and debias our fore-\ncasts accordingly so that we can tell if an option really is too expensive. Sowe adjust each forecast by subtracting the usual implied/forecast spread.\nFor example, the realized/implied spread for the S&P 500 can be\nloosely proxied by the spread between the rolling 30-day close-to-closevolatility and the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX).\n(The construction and interpretation of the VIX is covered in Appendix A.)\nThis is shown in Figure 2.11. Note that the VIX is almost always above the30-day rolling volatility. You need to know the average amount of this pre-\nmium.

The actual spread is shown in Figure 2.12. Here the average value\nis 3.09. This is the crucial value to remember. (Note also that the period\nin April 2007 where the spread went negative corresponds to a spike inthe 30-day close-to-close volatility. This was largely caused by the problem\nwith historical volatilities being backward-looking, as discussed earlier and\nshown in Figure 2.8.)\nFor position traders, context-adjusted volatility cones can be very use-\nful as they get to monitor volatility without having to continuously makemarkets. They can wait to establish a position as it reaches the highs (and\nthe market makers will generally be eager to lighten up their positions at\nthis point). Position traders have to take advantage of the fact that they canbe selective. Trading may look like a competitive activity but it shouldn\u2019t\nbe about posturing. There is no need to always have a position. Lions are\nsmart and powerful hunters, but they don\u2019t waste energy \ufb01ghting rhinos.They wait until the wounded antelope gets separated from the herd.\nSUMMARY\nMeasuring and forecasting volatility is essential when trading options.Forecasting in particular is something of an art, and the selection of anestimator (or more probably a combination of estimators), a sampling\nfrequency, and a forecasting methodology will need to be based on\nexperience. Some methods work better in different market conditionsthan others. However, there are a number of things that should always be\nconsidered:\nrEstimate volatility using a variety of methods, keeping in mind the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each.rTry to choose a sample length that achieves a balance between includ-\ning data from periods that is no longer relevant and using too little data\nso that sampling error dominates.\nc02 JWBK128-Sinclair April 15, 2008 5:7 Char Count=\n44 VOLATILITY TRADING\nrPlace the forecast in context by using a volatility cone.rFurther consider the state of the entire market to determine if the par-\nticular implied volatility under examination is at an extreme level or\nwhether this is just an appropriate level given the state of the broadmarket.\nrBe selective with your trades. Wait for an edge that is clear, measur-able, and understandable.\nc03 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 12:43 Char Count=\nCHAPTER 3\nImplied Volatility\nDynamics\nIn the previous chapter we looked at ways to measure and forecast re-\nalized volatility. In a sports gambling context this would be akin to us\nforecasting which team would be most likely to win the game. In this\nchapter we look at the ways implied volatility can move. This would be the\nequivalent of predicting how the bookmakers\u2019 line might move before the\ngame. Remember that we are not trading either realized or implied volatil-ity directly. We are trading the spread between the two, so edge can be\nfound on both sides.\nIt is dif\ufb01cult to talk about the characteristics of theimplied volatility\nbecause there are a number of implied volatilities; generally each distinctput/call pair has its own volatility. This forms the well-known volatility sur-\nface. Figure 3.1 shows a fairly typical volatility surface for a set of index\noptions, the NASDAQ-100 Trust Series 1 exchange-traded fund (QQQQ). It\nhas signi\ufb01cant structure both across strikes and maturity. We separatelyshow the strike and term structure in Figures 3.2 and 3.3.\nBefore we analyze the shapes that the surface takes, let\u2019s take a mo-\nment to remember what is important to us as traders. We are primarilyinterested in things that move. Shapes are less important to us. Changes\nin shapes may be important. If we were trading structured products thismay well not be the case. Here the volatility smile would be an input toanother model, and taking the shape into account could be necessary to\navoid arbitrage.\nOne way of determining the relative importance of different types\nof movement is principal component analysis (PCA). This is a mathe-matical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data sets.

Skiadopoulos, Hodges, and Clelow (2000) applied PCA to changes ofS&P 500 implied volatilities for given maturity buckets, using both strike\nand moneyness metrics. Alexander (2001b) applied PCA to daily changes\nin the deviations of strike volatilities from the at-the-money (ATM) volatil-\nities. Alexander\u2019s work is most directly useful to us.

So the most im-portant thing to understand is the dynamics of the overall level of volatility,\nfollowed by the slope of the curve. Don\u2019t ever forget this point. The dynam-\nics of the smile can be seductive, and a lot of very smart people have spenta lot of time and money examining its dynamics, but the level of volatility\nis many times more changeable and hence more economically signi\ufb01cant.\nThe fact that the overall level of implied volatility is the dominant risk\nfactor also partially addresses the objection that the at-the-money implied\nvolatility is not the correct thing to compare to our realized volatility fore-\ncast. Technically this is correct. We should compare our volatility forecastto the implied volatility swap, a structure consisting of the weighted av-\nerage of a continuum of option prices. But in practice this isn\u2019t really a\nvery good way to go about trading the implied/realized spread, for several\nreasons:\nrThe number of available strikes is usually very limited so the con-\nstructed swap will not be particularly close to its ideal.rThe bid/ask spread in the options that needs to be crossed makes con-struction of the swap very expensive.\nrAt-the-money volatility movement dominates the movement of the im-\nplied volatility surface.rVisual inspection of the payoff structure of a straddle position should\nvery clearly show that this position is dependent on the absolute move-\nment of the underlying (see Figure 3.4).

Details of the VIX calculation can be found in Appendix A.Figure 3.5 shows the VIX from its inception at the start of 1990 until the\nend of July 2007.\nc03 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 12:43 Char Count=\nImplied Volatility Dynamics 49\n05101520253035404550\n1/2/1990\n1/2/1991\n1/2/1992\n1/2/1993\n1/2/1994\n1/2/1995\n1/2/1996\n1/2/1997\n1/2/1998\n1/2/1999\n1/2/2000\n1/2/2001\n1/2/2002\n1/2/2003\n1/2/2004\n1/2/2005\n1/2/20061/2/2007VIX\nFIGURE 3.5 The VIX Implied Volatility Index\nSeveral crude features can be seen immediately:\nrThe level of the VIX has two regimes: a high and volatile regime where\nit oscillates between 20 and 40, and a regime where it is quieter and\nstays between 10 and 20.rThe volatility of the index is positively related to the level.rThere are more large moves up than down.rIt seems to be, locally at least, mean-reverting.\nThis last statement needs further elaboration as it is something that is\noften said but equally often left unde\ufb01ned. (See accompanying box.)\nMean Reversion\nTraders and analysts often say that volatility is a mean-reverting process\n(this was a reason that we preferred the GARCH model to the EWMA for\nforecasting realized volatility), but there is often a lack of precision in whatthey mean. Here we look at several di\ufb00erent de\ufb01nitions of mean reversion\nso we can have some unambiguous things to look for when discussing the\ndynamics of implied volatility. (Incidentally, the same ambiguity exists whendiscussing trends in \ufb01nancial markets. It often seems obvious in retrospect\nthat a trend has occurred but traders \ufb01nd it di\ufb03cult to de\ufb01ne in advance\nexactly what one is).\n(continued)\nc03 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 12:43 Char Count=\n50 VOLATILITY TRADING\nInformal De\ufb01nition\nA time series is mean-reverting if it falls after reaching a maximum and\nrises after reaching a minimum.\nThis de\ufb01nition is intuitively appealing. All that needs to be done is to\nlook at the series, \ufb01nd the extreme values, and then see if the series subse-quently retreated from these. According to this thinking, the equity market\nwas clearly undervalued in the early 1980s and drastically overvalued in themiddle of 1987. Unfortunately, this de\ufb01nition is also self-ful\ufb01lling. It is a\ntruism to say that a series will be lower after its maximum. This applies to\nany series at all. We will need to come up with something more falsi\ufb01able.\nMore Formal De\ufb01nition\nA time series is mean-reverting if its returns have negative autocorrelation.\nUnder this de\ufb01nition a below-average return in one period is compen-\nsated for by a higher-than-average return in subsequent periods. The VIX ismean-reverting under this de\ufb01nition. It has a daily autocorrelation of \u22120.04,\nweekly of \u22120.21, and monthly of \u22120.12.\nThis model can be simply expressed as\nR\nt=\u03c1(Rt\u22121\u2212\u00b5)+\u00b5+\u03c3Zt (3.1)\nwhere\nRare the returns at time t\n\u03c1is the autocorrelation\n\u00b5is the mean return\n\u03c3is the volatility of the returns\nZis a draw from a standard normal distribution\nA realization of this process is given in Figure 3.6.Now contrast this with Figure 3.7.This is not proof of anything. But it is certainly suggestive that this\nform of mean reversion is applicable to the VIX, at least for short periods.\nA Traders\u2019 De\ufb01nition\nA time series is mean-reverting if it can be pro\ufb01tably traded by methodsthat assume that moves tend to reverse instead of continue.\nThis de\ufb01nition allows for a lot of di\ufb00erent processes. It is far broader\nthan assuming negative autocorrelation. A number of the classical technicalindicators can form the basis for such a system. (Please note that we areasserting nothing about the general e\ufb03cacy of technical analysis; it is just\nbeing used as a test in this speci\ufb01c case.)\nc03 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 12:43 Char Count=\nImplied Volatility Dynamics 51\n\u221210\u22128\u22126\u22124\u221220\n1\n3579\n11\n13151719\n21\n232527293133353739414345\n47\n49512\nTimeRt46810\nFIGURE 3.6 A Mean-Reverting Random Process as Described by\nEquation 3.1\n(The parameters were \u00b5=0,\u03c1=\u22120.2, and \u03c3=2.8)\nThe VIX also passes this test.

We don\u2019t aim to make a viable trading system. We just\nclaim that the VIX does what a trader expects a mean-reverting time seriesto do. (This system is useless in practice as the VIX index doesn\u2019t trade and\nthe futures are wide enough that this would not be pro\ufb01table. Sadly, things\nthat are easy to price are usually hard to trade.)\nHowever, the central idea behind this very simple system is important.\nLarge implied volatility moves will often reverse. This should be kept inmind when we enter option positions.\nMore formal time series models give mixed results. Some researchers\nhave claimed success in their predictions of implied volatility (Ahoniemi\n2006; Brooks and Oozeer 2006) but the models seem to be of limited prac-\ntical use as trading tools.\nHowever there are very clear regularities in the evolution of at-the-\nmoney implied volatilities that can form the basis of trades. An exam-ple is the evolution of implied volatilities before a company\u2019s earnings\nannouncement. The front-month volatility will almost always rise signi\ufb01-cantly in the weeks before the earnings release. An example is shown in\nFigure 3.8, where we see the evolution of the front-month volatility for Ap-\nple (AAPL) for the month before the second-quarter earnings announce-ment after the close on April 25, 2007. This pattern of implied volatility ris-\ning before the announcement, then dropping once the news is released, is\nubiquitous.\n0.30.320.340.36\n0.20.220.240.260.28\n5/3/07 4/28/07 4/23/07 4/18/07 4/13/07 4/8/07 4/3/07 3/29/07 3/24/07 3/19/07Implied Volatility\nDate\nFIGURE 3.8 The AAPL Front-Month Volatility around the Second Quarter 2007\nEarnings Release\nc03 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 12:43 Char Count=\nImplied Volatility Dynamics 53\nIt certainly appears that there is a trading opportunity here. Actually\nthere are two. The \ufb01rst idea is to buy implied volatility a few weeks be-\nfore earnings in anticipation of implied volatility rising. This can sometimes\nwork. Remember, though, that while implied volatility will be rising, theactual prices of the options will probably not be: You will need the vega\npro\ufb01ts and the pro\ufb01ts from scalping the long gamma to offset the decay of\nthe options due to the passing of time. This is certainly worth looking for,although transaction costs limit the applicability of the idea to the more\nactive stocks.\nThe idea is also applicable to other products. For example, interest\nrate products display a similar pattern before large economic releases, andcommodity implied volatilities generally rise before inventory or crop re-\nports. Indeed, a study by Carr Futures (Panos 1997) showed that fromJanuary 1994 until December 1996, buying delta-neutral straddles at the\nclose on the Monday of the week of an unemployment report (released\non Friday before the market open) and selling at the close on Thurs-day would have realized a pro\ufb01t of about 9 option ticks (a 6.53 percent\nreturn).\nThe other possible trading opportunity is inspired by the observation\nthat implied volatility drops dramatically after the announcement. Again,this is a widespread phenomenon. To pro\ufb01t from this we would need to sell\noptions before the announcement and hope that the move in the underlying\nwasn\u2019t so large that our gamma losses didn\u2019t overwhelm our pro\ufb01ts from\nthe implied volatility drop. To evaluate this, we need to be able to calculatethe jump in the underlying price that is being implied by the option prices.\nTo \ufb01nd the implied jump, we compare the ATM implied volatilities of the\nfront-month and second-month options. The assumption is that just beforethe event, most of the difference will due to the uncertainty because of the\nannouncement. There may also be other reasons for the difference but we\nhope the event is the dominant one.\nFirst note that if the front-month implied volatility is lower than that\nof the second month, the event is not being projected to cause any move-ment. If the front month is higher than the second month, we need to \ufb01rstcalculate the forward volatility, \u03c3\n12, the volatility being implied from the\n\ufb01rst expiration at T 1until the second expiration at T 2.T h i si s\n\u03c312=/radicalBigg\n\u03c32\n2T2\u2212\u03c32\n1T1\nT2\u2212T1(3.2)\nwhere\n\u03c31is the implied volatility of the front month\n\u03c32is the implied volatility of the second month\nc03 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 12:43 Char Count=\n54 VOLATILITY TRADING\nThe volatility attributed to the event, \u03c3E, is the difference of the front\nmonth volatility and the forward volatility.\n\u03c3E=/radicalBig\nT1/parenleftbig\n\u03c32\n1\u2212\u03c32\n12/parenrightbig\n=/radicalBigg\n/parenleftbig\n\u03c32\n1\u2212\u03c32\n2/parenrightbigT1T2\nT2\u2212T1(3.3)\nNow, using equation (2.12) we \ufb01nd that the expected absolute return (the\njump)i s\nE(|R|)=/radicalbigg\n2\n\u03c0\u03c3E (3.4)\nUsing equation (3.4) we can \ufb01nd the expected jump from the front two im-\nplied volatilities and compare this to our estimate of the actual move in the\nunderlying. This is probably a more dif\ufb01cult trade: You need an estimate ofthe move that is more accurate than the market\u2019s. Further, even if you are\ncorrect, there will be signi\ufb01cant volatility in the results of the trade. This\nis not the same as predicting realized volatility over the life of an option.\nPredicting volatility is predicting an average. This trade is dependent on\npredicting the move on a single day, and an abnormal day at that.\nSMILE DYNAMICS\nNext we can examine the nature of the smile. We said earlier that the smileisn\u2019t as signi\ufb01cant as the level of volatility. This is true, but it isn\u2019t totallyinsigni\ufb01cant. There are several academic studies that show that smile ef-\nfects are pro\ufb01tably tradable if transaction costs are suf\ufb01ciently small (e.g.,\nGoncalves and Guidolin 2005; Jha and Kalimipalli 2006). Also, all tradersneed to be able to monitor and understand the smile in order to \ufb01nd the\nbest strikes to trade. This becomes most relevant for products with a lot\nof strikes, so trades that isolate skewness (ratio spreads) and kurtosis\n(butter\ufb02ies and condors) are able to be constructed. It is also of most\nrelevance to market makers who can enter multilegged positions withoutcrossing the entire bid/ask spread in the option market.\nSmiles exist for a number of reasons (this list is not exhaustive):\nrIn many products the typical end user is long and will naturally buydownside protection.\nrIn equity products, longs may also have a propensity to sell callsagainst their long stock positions.\nrUpside strikes often trade at a premium to the at-the-money strike in\nequities, due to the implied chance of a takeover. (Obviously this will\nc03 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 12:43 Char Count=\nImplied Volatility Dynamics 55\ncreate a different curve than the previous effect, and which effect is\nstronger will be highly product- and period-speci\ufb01c.)rIf customers are long puts and short calls, then the market makers willbe short puts and long calls.

Typically the customers don\u2019t hedge (theoptions are their hedge) and the market makers do. At least some of\nthis hedging is dynamic, and if the market drops toward their shorts,\nthe market impact of their hedging will increase volatility. The oppositeoccurs if the market rallies toward their longs. In this sense the smile\nis a self-ful\ufb01lling prophecy of the dependency of volatility on the level\nof the underlying.\nrIn equity indexes the skew will be more pronounced than in the indi-\nvidual stocks that make up the index. The volatility of an index, \u03c3,i s\nrelated to the volatility of the components, \u03c3i,b y\n\u03c32=N/summationdisplay\ni=1w2\ni\u03c32\ni+2N\u22121/summationdisplay\ni=1/summationdisplay\nj>1wiwj\u03c1ij\u03c3i\u03c3j (3.5)\nwhere\nwiare the component weights\n\u03c1ijare the correlations between the components\nSo we can see that there are two ways the index volatility can increase:\nEither the component volatilities can increase or the correlations canincrease. Equation (3.5) is equally applicable to realized volatility and\ncorrelation and to implied volatility and correlation. So the implied\nvolatility of an index also contains an implied correlation effect. Even\nif all the components have \ufb02at implied volatility surface, the index can\nexhibit a smile if correlation is expected to increase as the underlyingmoves. And it is a generally held belief that correlation between stocks\nincreases in crashes or sharp downward moves.\nrThe actual underlying returns are not normally distributed; they exhibit\nboth skewness and kurtosis.\nAll but the last of these reasons are related to the buying (or selling)\npressure in the implied volatility market. This is very dif\ufb01cult to predict,\nbut the net effect tends to reach equilibrium in most markets. That is, the\nimplied volatility curve will take on a certain shape in a given product andthen basically keep that shape (Hafner and Wallmeier 2000: Cont and da\nFonseca 2002).\nWe need a way to quantify the shape of the smile so that we can mon-\nitor it for deviations from this equilibrium. At this point we are not sayingwhat the skew should be. We are only saying what it typically is.\nc03 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 12:43 Char Count=\n56 VOLATILITY TRADING\nBefore we get a little more technical, I would like to mention a very\nsimple way to parameterize volatility smiles. This lets us compare smiles\nand is useful as a quick way to do this across different expiries. It could\nalso be used to compare products of the same class, such as equity in-dexes or government bonds. We parameterize the smile by the delta of the\noption, and then divide all of the volatilities in a given month by the at-\nthe-money volatility of that month. This gives a curve that is remarkablyconstant through time. I am not aware of any reason why this should be\nso\u2014it could well just be an artifact of how market makers have always\npropagated their volatility smiles through time.\nTable 3.1 shows the surprising effectiveness of this method using the\nexample of the QQQQ options. In fact, given the amount of interpolationneeded and the width of the bid/ask spread in volatility terms, one couldmake the argument that in these terms all of the months had the same\nsmile. Not a bad start. However, this gives us no way to compare the im-\nplied volatilities to any properties of the realized distribution.\nWe will set up this problem in a way that is similar to our initial ap-\nproach to option pricing. We originally thought that options were only de-pendent on the square of moves in the underlying, which leads us to pricethem based on volatility. We did not think in terms of absolute moves in\nthe stock price. We used volatility because it would allow us to compare\ntwo underlyings with very different prices. Now we know that volatility\nisn\u2019t enough; our process was misspeci\ufb01ed. We need to extend the BSM\nmethodology to incorporate skewness and kurtosis.\nTABLE 3.1The Raw and Scaled Implied Volatilities of the QQQQ Options as a\nFunction of the Out-of-the-Money Delta From the Morning ofSeptember 13, 2007\nDeltaOct.\nrawvol.Nov.rawvol.Dec.rawvol.Mar.rawvol.Oct.Scalevol.Nov.Scalevol.Dec.Scalevol.Mar.Scalevol.\n1 0 3 5 . 83 5 . 53 3 3 2 1 . 4 71 . 4 71 . 4 61 . 4 4\n20 31.2 30.4 29.2 28 1.28 1.26 1.29 1.26\n30 28.8 27.8 26.5 25.7 1.18 1.15 1.17 1.16\n40 26.3 26 24 23.5 1.08 1.07 1.06 1.065 02 4 . 4 2 4 . 2 2 2 . 6 2 2 . 2 1111\n40 23.5 23.4 22.2 21.8 0.96 0.97 0.98 0.98\n30 22 21.8 20.7 20.3 0.9 0.9 0.92 0.9120 20.8 20.2 19.2 18.9 0.85 0.83 0.85 0.85\n10 18.7 18.6 17.8 17.6 0.77 0.77 0.79 0.79\nc03 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 12:43 Char Count=\nImplied Volatility Dynamics 57\nSkewness is de\ufb01ned by the third moment about the mean, normalized\nby the standard deviation.\n\u00b53=1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=1(xi\u2212\u00afx)3\n\u03c33(3.6)\nThis equation is very similar in form to equation (2.1).

And the minimumof the implied volatility occurs below the at-the-money strike.\nrThus the higher moments are somewhat intertwined in their effects.We cannot directly attribute a shift in the shape of the curve to eitherskewness or kurtosis.\nIt is possible to obtain negative option prices, and not just for implausi-\nble situations.

This idea was \ufb01rst proposed by Rubinstein (1998), who worked withthe Edgeworth expansion. Haug (2007b) provides code for both Edgeworth\nand Gram-Charlier trees.\nSUMMARY\nOption trading requires knowledge of two types of volatility: realized\nvolatility, which is a measure of the underlying\u2019s variability; and implied\nvolatility, which gives the market price of the options. We are interested inthe spread between these two volatilities. Implied volatility dynamics are\nalso tricky to quantify and forecast. Implied volatilities move more slowlythan realized volatilities, but implied volatilities have a term and strike\nstructure that also needs to be accounted for. Nonetheless, we can state\nsome general principles of which the trader should stay cognizant:\nrThe most important implied volatility for a trader is the at-the-moneylevel. Most of the implied volatility movement is a shift in the level of\nvolatility. The slope and curvature of the implied curve are of dimin-\nishing variability (and hence importance).\nrImplied volatility is mean-reverting.rThe shape of the implied volatility curve tends to be relatively stablein a given product, although the actual reason for the smile can varydramatically between products.\nrThe Corrado-Su model allows us to put implied skewness and impliedkurtosis on the same footing as implied volatility.\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\nCHAPTER 4\nHedging\nWe saw in Chapter 1 that the idea of hedging is central to the BSM\nframework. The concept of hedging was used in the derivation of\nthe BSM equation and it is necessary to hedge to remove exposure\nto the return of the underlying. To isolate our volatility exposure we need\nto hedge. Professional option traders are well aware of this. However, the\nactual process of hedging causes confusion and is subject to several mis-conceptions.\nThere is an old saying that any option trade can be pro\ufb01table if only it\nis hedged correctly. If hedging is thought of as part of the option tradingprocess, and not as a completely unrelated trading strategy, this is sim-\nply untrue. While it is possible that some traders have a special ability to\ntrade the underlying, this is not even the point of hedging. Hedging is about\nmitigating risk so that we can pro\ufb01t from our prediction of volatility. On av-\nerage, a trade will not make money unless we sell implied volatility higherthan realized volatility or buy it lower. Due to the dispersion of trade out-\ncomes around this outcome, enough trades that were based on an incorrect\nvolatility prediction will be winners to keep some traders convinced thatthis is not true. That is okay. They are wrong\u2014and in a zero sum game,\nhaving some participants mistaken about a fundamental aspect of trading\ncan only help the rest of us.\nEven if a trader can pro\ufb01tably trade both volatility and the direction\nof the underlying, he should not forget the fact that these are two separatestrategies. Further, even the best directional traders will not always havea view on the underlying, while an option trader always needs a hedging\nplan. In this chapter we devise such a plan.\n63\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\n64 VOLATILITY TRADING\nIf we could trade the underlying in any size we wanted and without\nincurring any costs, we should do so and continuously adjust our stock\nposition to remain delta-neutral. As we saw in Chapter 1, this would make\nour pro\ufb01t a function of the difference between the implied volatility and therealized volatility. However, in the real world we can only trade in discrete\nsize, and each trade costs us money in commissions and bid/ask spreads.\nThis makes continuously adjusting delta impractical.\nThere are proofs that rely on mathematical properties of GBM to show\nthat the continuous replication demanded by the BSM model incurs in\ufb01nitetransaction costs over any time period, no matter how small. But thereis a further problem: When the underlying has a discrete bid/ask spread\nwe can never actually have a \ufb02at delta position anyway. Our gamma will\ncause us to have different deltas when valued against the bid or the offer.So in this case our delta will change even when the underlying isn\u2019t going\nanywhere. Hedging this bid/ask bounce would incur costs while removing\nno risk.\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of hedging cheaply and ef\ufb01-\nciently. Replication risks due to imperfect hedging can easily exceed theanticipated pro\ufb01ts from the perceived implied volatility mispricing. Trans-action costs from hedging can be large. They are also easy to ignore, as they\naccumulate progressively over the lifetime of the trade and are not easily\nperceived by traders, who tend to become focused on short-term results.\nTo see the extent of the issue, consider the following example. We are\nshort one thousand vega of at-the-money options on a stock initially pricedat $100 which have one year until expiry. Actual volatility is 40 percent\nand we sold the position at an implied volatility of 50 percent. Before any\ncosts, we expect to make a pro\ufb01t of $10,000 if we hold it until expiry. How-ever, the bid/ask spread in the underlying is $0.1. Table 4.1 shows the to-\ntal expected pro\ufb01t for this position if we hedge to a delta-neutral position\nat various frequencies. (These numbers were the results of a Monte Carlosimulation of this situation, where we looked at the average result of 10,000\nrealizations of this situation.)\nTABLE 4.1The Average Pro\ufb01t Realized When Rebalancing\nHedges at Di\ufb00erent Intervals (In a Perfect BSM WorldWe Would Make $10,000)\nHedge Frequency Average Realized Pro\ufb01t\nWeekly hedge $9,791\nDaily hedge $9,220\nTwice daily $8,830\nFive times daily $7,952\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\nHedging 65\nAD HOC HEDGING METHODS\nTraders use a number of different methods for deciding when to rebalance\ntheir hedge. Long after option pricing was considered a science, hedging\nwas still thought of as an art and as a result early hedging theories weresomewhat ad hoc.\nHedging at Regular Intervals\nOne of the simplest hedging strategies is to hedge at \ufb01xed time intervals.\nAt the end of each time period we execute an underlying trade that sets\nour delta to zero (or as close to it as possible after allowing for discrete\ntrading units). This practice is sometimes employed by large facilitation\ndesks that may have option positions in several hundred underlyings.At the end of each day the delta for each underlying is \ufb02attened. This is\nsimple to understand and implement, but it is totally arbitrary in the choice\nof time interval. Obviously hedging more often decreases risk. Equallyobviously hedging less often decreases costs. It should also be clear that a\none-week option should be hedged differently to a one-year option. A day\nin the life of a one-week option is far more signi\ufb01cant than a day in the lifeof a one-year option.\nHedging to a Delta Band\nThis is a strategy commonly used by market makers or traders who trade\nonly a few products. Here we choose a \ufb01xed delta that we are able to tol-\nerate. When our delta exceeds this we hedge.\nWe need to somehow choose the size of the band. Generally this is\ndone by considering the dollar risk we are exposed to by an unhedgeablegap move in the underlying, such as an opening price jump. This couldalso depend on the sign of the gamma in the portfolio. We may decide to\nbe looser in our hedging if we are long because an adverse move will be\npartially insured by the gamma. Having to make this choice isn\u2019t necessarilya problem\u2014we will see that such choices are inevitable. The problem is\nthat the choice should be dependent on the option position rather than\n\ufb01xed. This method relies on ad hoc adjustments to achieve this.\nHedging Based on Underlying Price Changes\nWhen using this strategy the trader rebalances the delta after the underly-ing has moved by a certain amount. This is based on the sensible idea that\nthe risk in the portfolio is due to underlying moves, so these should form\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\n66 VOLATILITY TRADING\nthe basis for rebalancing decisions. However, we are still left searching for\na method that tells us how to choose the appropriate price change. Traders\nalso need to decide whether to calibrate the method based on percentage\nchanges, dollar changes, technical levels of importance, or implied or his-torical standard deviations.\nUTILITY-BASED METHODS\nWe know that hedging is a trade-off between reducing risk and incurringcosts. When economists deal with such compromises they often turn to\nthe concept of utility. This gives us the necessary framework for deciding\nbetween different alternatives.\nUtility Theory\nImagine you are given a choice between receiving a certain amount of\nmoney or taking a bet which has a 50 percent chance of winning $100 anda 50 percent chance of winning nothing. Clearly the bet has an expected\nvalue of $50. If you would rather receive a certain payo\ufb00 of less than $50\nyou are risk averse. If you would take $50 you are risk-neutral. If you wouldonly accept more than $50 you are risk-seeking.\nThe certain amount that you would settle for is the called the certainty\nequivalent . If we plot a graph of certainty equivalent as a function of the\nbet size we can visualize our utility function. For a risk-averse trader the\nutility curve will have downward curvature. This means that the utility of a\ngiven amount of money is greater than the amount of money itself. Thiscan be seen in Figure 4.1. Conversely, the utility function for a risk-seeking\nMoneyUtility\nFIGURE 4.1 The Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Trader\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\nHedging 67\ntrader curves upwards. The utility of a given amount of money is less than\nthe amount of money itself. Such a utility curve is shown in Figure 4.2.\nThe two most important aspects of (sensible) utility functions for a\ntrader are that they slope up because we prefer more money to less, and\nthey curve downward because we become more risk-averse when larger\namounts are involved.\nWe can quantify our risk aversion by using the Arrow-Pratt absolute\nrisk aversion, which is de\ufb01ned by\nr=U/prime/prime(W)\nU/prime(W)(4.1)\nA commonly used utility function is the exponential utility function. It\nhas the functional form\nU(W)=\u2212exp(\u2212\u03b3 W)( 4.2)\nIt is unique in having constant absolute risk aversion as r =\u03b3is inde-\npendent of the wealth, W.\nLet\u2019s look at an example to see how we would \ufb01nd our risk tolerance.\nWe do this by asking questions about the certainty equivalents of riskyoutcomes that are normally distributed.\nSuppose the distribution of future wealth has a mean \u00b5and a standard\ndeviation \u03c3. For example, \u00b5=$10,000 and \u03c3=$2,000.\nMoneyUtility\nFIGURE 4.2 The Utility Function for a Risk-Seeking Trader\n(continued)\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\n68 VOLATILITY TRADING\nSo\nE[U]=E[\u2212exp(\u2212\u03b3W)] (4.3)\n\u2248\u2212exp/parenleftbigg\n\u2212\u03b3/parenleftbigg\n\u00b5\u22121\n2\u03b3\u03c32/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg\n(4.4)\nSo the certainty equivalent, W 0,i sg i v e nb y\nW0=\u00b5\u22121\n2\u03b3\u03c32(4.5)\nThis can be inverted to give an expression for the risk aversion, \u03bb.\n\u03b3=2(\u00b5\u2212W0)\n\u03c32(4.6)\nNow suppose that the trader is indi\ufb00erent between this distribution of\nwealth and a certain outcome of $8,000; that is, W 0=$8,000.

Quite a large amount of variability tends to be found.\nReal traders tend to exhibit little consistency in their risk appetites, either\nthrough time or as a function of the amount of the money at stake. Many be-\nhavioral \ufb01nance studies directly address this point (Kahneman and Tversky1979; Barberis et al. 2001).\nFor this and other reasons, the use of utility functions in economics\nhas been subject to criticism (Mirowski 1989; McCauley 2004). This needn\u2019toverly concern us. As with our use of the BSM model, utility is just a frame-\nwork for us to think within. While a trader may never speci\ufb01cally know his\nutility function and while his risk aversion may change, it isn\u2019t unreason-able to state that he prefers more to less and is risk-averse. This is all we\nreally need.\nHodges and Neuberger (1989) recognized that as BSM really prices the\nreplication strategy", "doc_id": "2b39f1a3-21dd-4596-9c7c-ccdcc5a2ff68", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1e3bca1a65e43f7a231ff8ab0eee1956ebbc7769985563add7159a65f35a8ae6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 131418, "end": 144914}, "relationships": {"1": "cba938a9-dc3f-413e-8698-8075f9677354", "2": "02ebb316-8096-457e-bd60-e285150c962f", "3": "0ccce90b-f795-472b-a136-4edfe356df7d"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ccce90b-f795-472b-a136-4edfe356df7d": {"text": "Many be-\nhavioral \ufb01nance studies directly address this point (Kahneman and Tversky1979; Barberis et al. 2001).\nFor this and other reasons, the use of utility functions in economics\nhas been subject to criticism (Mirowski 1989; McCauley 2004).

This is all we\nreally need.\nHodges and Neuberger (1989) recognized that as BSM really prices the\nreplication strategy rather than the option directly, they could do the same\nthing but incorporating transaction costs. Actually, including transaction\ncosts was \ufb01rst done by Leland (1985) but, while his results led to pricing theoption with a modi\ufb01ed volatility to allow for the costs of hedging, we still\nneed to continuously adjust the hedge. So this doesn\u2019t address the practical\nproblem of when best to hedge.\nThe most important idea in Hodges and Neuberger\u2019s paper is that there\ncomes a point where the option trader is indifferent (in the utility sense)\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\nHedging 69\nto holding the risk associated with the mis-hedged option and the cost\nassociated with hedging it. If we can specify our level of risk aversion,\nthis strategy is optimal. They formulated the problem in terms of maximiz-\ning the exponential utility function, but it was subsequently proved (Daviset al. 1993; Andersen and Damgaard 1999) that the results are basically in-\ndependent of the precise form of the utility function. As mentioned in the\naccompanying box on utility, we would be justi\ufb01ed in being suspicious ofany result that didn\u2019t have this property.\nThe mathematics required to formulate the problem are beyond the\nscope of this book. Sadly, the resulting valuation equation has no analyticsolution and needs to be solved numerically. Even this is not easy. The\nrequired computations are prohibitively time consuming. There is no prac-\ntical way to use the Hodges-Neuberger (HN) methodology as a real-timehedging guide.\nBut because it is the optimal solution, its properties are important to\nunderstand. Figures 4.3 and 4.4 show the hedging bandwidth for a long callposition and a short call position. When our position\u2019s delta moves out-\nside the band, we hedge to bring our delta back to the edge of the band.\n(This is only true if we assume that the counterparty in an option tradehas no ability to predict the direction of the underlying. There is some evi-\ndence that option customers are partially informed. In this case we should\nimmediately hedge the delta of any new option trade to the BSM delta.\nHowever, subsequent delta rehedging would follow the HN scheme and we\nwould only hedge if we moved outside the bands. It probably wouldn\u2019t bewise to overhedge the original trade to achieve the same directional risk\nas the counterparty, unless you had a very clear idea of the magnitude and\nduration of the customer\u2019s directional trading ability.

The parameters chosen are not particularly realistic\nbut have been chosen to exaggerate the properties of the solution. We\nchose the case of a one-year option with volatility of 0.3, transaction costsof 2 percent, zero interest and carry rates, and a risk aversion of one\nSeveral points are immediately obvious. First of all, the short and long\npositions need to be hedged differently. The band for the short position isnarrower. So we hedge our short positions more defensively. We have time\ndecay on our side so we take less chance with delta, whereas when we are\nhedging long positions we need to let our deltas run. Interestingly, this isin accordance with trader folklore.\nAnother way to see why this should be so is to note that the hedger of\na long position sees a different level of volatility to that seen by the hedgerof a short position. As the underlying reaches a new high, a short gamma\nhedger will be inclined to buy. In doing so, he will make the high even\nhigher by paying the offer. In contrast, a seller sells at the bid, slightly lower\nthan the high. The cumulative effect of crossing bid/ask like this means that\nthe long and short positions have different volatility levels to contend with.\nThis was the central result of Leland\u2019s. He showed that the adjusted\nvolatility for a long option position was\n\u02c6\u03c3=\u03c3/radicalBigg\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\u03c3/radicalbigg\n8\n\u03c0/Delta1t(4.7)\nwhere\n\u03bbis the proportional transaction cost\n/Delta1tis the time between rebalancing\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\nHedging 71\nFor a short option position, the adjusted volatility is\n\u02c6\u03c3=\u03c3/radicalBigg\n1+\u03bb\n\u03c3/radicalbigg\n8\n\u03c0/Delta1t(4.8)\nWhile we do not explicitly use Leland\u2019s results to determine our\nhedging strategy, these are very important results. Before doing any option\ntrade, we need to be aware approximately how much edge will be eroded\nby cumulative delta hedging. This effect can be considerable, particularlyfor low-volatility, illiquid stocks. For example, if fair volatility is 10 percent\nand the bid/ask spread is 1 percent, an option that is rehedged daily would\nneed to be sold at an implied volatility of over 15.9 percent to accountfor this.\nAdditionally, the optimal delta band does not span the BSM delta. A\nperfectly hedged portfolio in the BSM world may need to be adjusted when\ntransaction costs are present. This is also consistent with Leland\u2019s obser-\nvation because if an out-of-the-money call sees a higher volatility, due tothe dependency of the option\u2019s delta on volatility, it acts like it has a higher\ndelta. Similarly, an in-the-money option acts like it has a lower delta. This\ncauses the hedging band to be centered around an S-shaped modi\ufb01ed delta,rather than the BSM delta.\nThe preceding analysis was done for European options but the general\nidea can be extended to cover American options. This is similar to the BSMmodel, where the partial differential equation is general but the methods\nused to solve it are dependent on the exact boundary conditions. This\ncaveat also applies to the other models we look at. We can normally expectthe results for American options to be similar to those obtained for Euro-\npean options (in most cases Americans can be thought of as Europeans).\nNot evident from Figures 4.3 and 4.4, but the essential feature of the\nmodel, is that the width of the hedging band is dependent on the riskaversion. A large risk-aversion parameter means that the trader wants to\naccept little risk. So he wants tight hedging bands and will hedge often.\nConversely, a trader with a small risk-aversion parameter will be prepared\nto hedge less frequently, accepting risk to reduce hedging costs. Neither ofthese choices is more correct than the other. As with all hedging methods,\nwe need to decide how risk-averse we are. But given this choice, the HN\nformalism gives us the optimal balance between risk and reward.\nThe Asymptotic Solution of Whalley and Wilmott\nIf we assume that the transaction costs are small (relative to the value ofthe option in the BSM world), it is possible to derive some approximate\nsolutions to the full problem. This was \ufb01rst done by Whalley and Wilmott\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\n72 VOLATILITY TRADING\n(1997).

In particular it can handle transaction costs proportional to the\nnumber of shares, as opposed to being proportional to the value of\nthe shares as in equation (4.10). Ticket charges and brokerage are ex-amples of such costs. And it is a matter of some debate whether the\nbid/ask spread (the dominant cost) should be modeled this way. We\naddress this later in this chapter. The model can also accommodatethe generally unrealistic situation where the costs are a single \ufb01xed\ncharge. This might be the case if there is a very high trade cost that is\nset irrespective of the size of the trade. This would possibly impact aretail customer but will not be relevant to even a semiprofessional.\nThe Whalley and Wilmott (WW) method also has some unfortunate\naspects:\nrThe asymmetry of long and short gamma positions that came out of\nthe full HN solution is lost. Only the magnitude of gamma is relevant to\nthe asymptotic solution.rThe hedging band is now centered on the BSM delta, losing anotherfeature of the full HN solution.\nA problem can arise in practice. If a trader sees an underlying get\nchoppy or start whipping around, it isn\u2019t always obvious whether he shouldadjust the bid/ask spread or increase the volatility. To the trader these havethe same primary impact: They both make hedging more dif\ufb01cult. However,\nthe effect in these models (HN and WW) is very different. For an at-the-\nmoney option, increasing the volatility will lower the gamma, which leadsto a tighter hedging band. But increasing the bid/ask spread (the propor-\ntional transaction cost) leads to a wider hedging band. How do we deal\nwith this important practical issue? The discrepancy is caused by the factthat these models explicitly incorporate risk aversion. Volatility is a traded\nquantity. It contains both risk and reward. When volatility is high these\nmodels tell us to fear the worst and hedge often. But the bid/ask spread ispurely a cost. It has no rewarding aspects. If the bid/ask spread is wide, the\nmodels tell us to hold off hedging to avoid multiple whipsaw losses.\n1The\ntrader needs to consider this and think carefully about what aspect of themarket is really changing. Volatility isn\u2019t the same as transaction costs at\nall (even a perfect, frictionless market has volatility), but they can look thesame at \ufb01rst glance.\n1This helpful explanation is from Johnny at www.nuclearphynance.com.\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\n74 VOLATILITY TRADING\nWhile not really feasible in many market situations, it is possible to\nseparately statistically estimate transaction costs and volatility. Transac-\ntion costs can be estimated by keeping track of the difference between our\nexecution price and the previous trade. It is completely a microstructure is-sue (although what constitutes microstructure can vary between traders;\nFidelity will have a very different view of transaction costs than a marketmaker standing in the crude oil pit at the NYMEX).Volatility can be esti-mated by using a time period that includes a large number of trades of a\nsize relevant to the particular trader.\nJust as with the BSM model, these hedging schemes should not be\nthought of as true models of reality. They just give a consistent and system-atic framework for dealing with the world. This particular issue emphasizes\nthis fact.\nThe Double Asymptotic Method of Zakamouline\nThe two relatively simple transaction cost models are those of Leland and\nWhalley and Wilmott. They can both be viewed as special cases of the\nHodges and Neuberger model: Leland describes how to replicate an op-tion in the presence of transaction costs when we are risk-neutral; Whalley\nand Wilmott incorporate risk aversion but insist on the costs being small.\nWhile these models are simple to apply and use, and will almost cer-\ntainly be an improvement over more ad hoc methods, they lose some of theappealing aspects of the full HN model. More crucially, careful numerical\nsimulations show that the approximations can signi\ufb01cantly underperformthe full strategy\u2014in other words, for a given level of transaction costs, a\nportfolio hedged with the WW model will experience more variance than\none hedged according to the HN model. (This isn\u2019t really a criticism. It\nshould be obvious that an approximation won\u2019t perform as well as the full\nmodel.)\nZakamouline (2006a, b, and c) examined the stylized facts of the nature\nof the utility-based hedging strategies (essentially", "doc_id": "0ccce90b-f795-472b-a136-4edfe356df7d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "02f1a962d1e89a07ef8dbb017c998a21e378ac8e0b962dda11a43ecc85220405", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 144824, "end": 158520}, "relationships": {"1": "cba938a9-dc3f-413e-8698-8075f9677354", "2": "2b39f1a3-21dd-4596-9c7c-ccdcc5a2ff68", "3": "a536cd19-60dd-4137-ae06-855b5b8153ba"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a536cd19-60dd-4137-ae06-855b5b8153ba": {"text": "models are simple to apply and use, and will almost cer-\ntainly be an improvement over more ad hoc methods, they lose some of theappealing aspects of the full HN model.

The strategies don\u2019t all do the same thing. Some are\nbased on time increments and some are based on price moves. For exam-\nple, consider the regular time interval rebalancing method. First we choosea time period; then we perform a simulation and compute the risk and re-\nturn of the strategy. Then we vary the time interval and repeat the process.\nEventually we will obtain an ef\ufb01cient frontier for the strategy. We do this\nfor each strategy and compare the frontiers. This lets us \ufb01nd the best strat-\negy (in return terms) for a given level of risk. For return we choose thereplication error: the total effect of all of the transaction costs. For risk\nwe choose the variance of the replication error. This means we evaluate\nrisk in the familiar mean-variance framework, but other risk measures arecertainly valid (refer to Chapter 7 for a discussion of the strengths and\ndrawbacks of some of these measures).\nSimulations of this type were carried out by Zakamouline (2005, 2006b)\nand Martellini and Priaulet (2002). Zakamouline simulated the hedgingof a short position in a one-year call option. The time hedging inter-\nvals varied from 1.25 (trading) days to 50 days. The parameters of theother models were chosen so that the \ufb01nal results were all in a simi-\nlar part of the mean-variance surface. (This is similar to how a trader\nwould use the models. He would calibrate a new hedging model by saying,\u201cCurrently my hedging strategy leaves me with X amount of risk. If I have\nthe new model leave me with the same amount of risk, how much money\ndo I save?\u201d)\nNumerical simulations show that Zakamouline\u2019s approximation clearly\ndominates the others. By this we mean that for a given level of risk, the\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\nHedging 77\nstrategy costs the least to implement. Ideally we would like one strategy to\ndominate for all levels of risk. This doesn\u2019t completely happen. The relative\nquality of the different strategies is dependent on the level of risk aversion\nand the level of transaction costs.\nA further consideration when choosing a hedging strategy is that not\nall are equally easy to implement. The Hodges-Neuberger scheme is at oneextreme in that it is the optimal solution but practically impossible to use.The Zakamouline scheme is a better approximation to this ideal than is\nthe Wilmott-Whalley method, but it is also more dif\ufb01cult to use in practice\nas some trading software doesn\u2019t easily facilitate its implementation (inparticular, the change in delta with respect to volatility is not calculated by\nall systems).\nAnother complication is that an option position will often have a\ngamma pro\ufb01le that changes sign as a function of the underlying. For ex-ample, consider the long butter\ufb02y position consisting of long a 90 percent\ncall, short two 100 percent calls and long one 110 percent call. This has thepayoff shown in Figure 4.8.\nImagine that we managed to somehow enter this position for zero cost.\nWe are now in the fantastic situation of having a position that can onlymake money\u2014but only if we do not continuously hedge it! If the underlying\n\ufb02uctuates between the 90 percent and 110 percent strikes we will always\nbe short gamma, and if we hedge the deltas that we accumulate, buying\nhigh and selling low, we can easily lose money. This example should tell\nus two very important things. First, the dynamic hedging strategy needs totake the global gamma pro\ufb01le into account. Second, if we can cheaply work\ninto a static hedge with other options, this is vastly preferable to dynamic\nhedging with the underlying.\n00.511.522.5\n80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120\nMoneynessProfit/Initial Cost\nFIGURE 4.8 The Payo\ufb00 of a Butter\ufb02y Spread as a Function of Moneyness\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\n78 VOLATILITY TRADING\nThere is a more important point that needs to be made here. As we\nemphasize throughout this book, it is vital to \ufb01gure out exactly what one\nis trying to achieve at any point in the trading process. Speci\ufb01cally, what\nis the point of hedging? Super\ufb01cially it is to remove exposure to the direc-tion of the underlying market. More generally it is to remove exposure to\nrisks we do not wish to accept while keeping exposure to those we do. If\nwe are market-making options, our edge comes from collecting the bid/askspread. To keep as much of this as possible, we should hedge as much of\nour volatility exposure as we can by trading other options (preferably by\ncollecting the spread on these as well). This is covered as a practical prob-lem in Baird (1992) and Taleb (1997) and in a more formal setting by Carr\net al. (1998) and Hua and Wilmott (1999). However, if we explicitly set out\nto take a position on the spread between realized and implied volatilities,then this will generally not be possible. Dynamic hedging can still leave a\nlot of risks, but sometimes we actually want to take that risk on.\nThis is not a problem to approach in too dogmatic a manner. It needs to\nbe understood and mitigated to some degree and accepted to some degree.The basic ways to deal with the problem can be summarized as follows.\nrInoculate your volatility bet from the effect of jumps by buying optionsin the wings if you are short at-the-money options. (If you are long\noptions, you want exposure to jumps.)\nrTry to diversify jump risk across products.rSize each position to limit total losses.rDon\u2019t base your evaluation of the worst thing that could happen on\nthe worst thing that has happened in the past. If you are selling volatil-\nity, part of your premium exists because you are selling insurance pre-mium for events that have never happened before.\nESTIMATION OF TRANSACTION COSTS\nThe \ufb01xed components of trading costs for any underlying trade are triv-\nial to \ufb01gure out. They consist of any brokerage, exchange, and clearing\nfees. More dif\ufb01cult are the proportional transaction costs, which are heav-ily dominated by the bid/ask spread. If we are trading small enough this\nwill be equal to half the quoted bid/ask spread. This is likely to be the case\nfor individual traders trading interest rate products or indexes. However,we will always reach a size where the market impact of the trade will sig-\nni\ufb01cantly alter the price we receive from the one that we saw quoted when\nwe \ufb01rst started to hedge.\nGenerally, market depth looks something like that shown in Table 4.2\nand Figure 4.9, where there is something like a V-shaped distribution for\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\nHedging 79\nTABLE 4.2Market Depth for Merrill Lynch (MER) at 9:13 CST on\nAugust 24, 2007\nBid Size Bid Price O\ufb00er Price O\ufb00er Size\n200 75.42 75.44 200\n3,000 75.4 75.45 500\n200 75.38 75.54 500\n900 75.31 75.81 10,000\n100 75.27 75.82 900\n500 75.12 75.99 1,300\n100 75.00 76.10 1,000\n1,100 74.5 76.42 900\n100 73.66 77.47 100\nthe cumulative size of bids and offers as a function of distance from the\ncurrent price.\nBut what we actually see at any time in the order book is unlikely to\nbe the actual total share quantity that we could trade. For example, we seethat if we went to the market to buy 1,000 Merrill Lynch shares we wouldbe \ufb01lled at an average of 75.475 (200 at 75.44, 500 at 75.45, and 300 at 75.54)\nbut in reality we would often be \ufb01lled better, for two reasons. First, we\nare only seeing resting limit orders in the book. If we were to split ourorder into smaller blocks and execute these separately, our buying would\nbe likely to induce new selling orders to enter the market (in theory, that is\n02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,00016,00018,000\n73 73.5 74 74.5 75 75.5 76 76.5 77 77.5 78Cumulative Volume\nPrice\nFIGURE 4.9 The Cumulative Number of Shares Available as a Function of Price\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\n80 VOLATILITY TRADING\nwhat a specialist is supposed to do). But of increasing relevance is the issue\nofdark liquidity .2There are a number of algorithms, formerly the preserve\nof fairly sophisticated algorithmic trading hedge funds but now available tomost institutional traders, that won\u2019t show the entire trade to the marketat once. A simple example is the iceberg order. Say we wanted to buy 1,000\nMerrill Lynch. An iceberg might buy the 700 offered up to 75.44 and thenbid 75.44 on 100. If we are \ufb01lled on this bid, the system automatically bids75.44 for another 100 until our total order is \ufb01lled. This type of order is\nnamed iceberg because at any point we only see the tip of the order, most\nof it remaining hidden.\nSo we need to estimate market impact transaction costs as a func-\ntion of order size. Just looking at the current market is not enough.\nSimilar to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in quantum physics, ourinteraction with the market changes the market. We need a fairly robust\nway of measuring the effect of this interaction. This problem is one that\nis still an active area of research in market microstructure, but we willpresent a simple yet powerful model that captures many aspects of the sit-\nuation, is easy to use, and is a good starting point for any further research.\nThis form of market impact analysis was \ufb01rst proposed at Merrill Lynch\n(Gatheral 2001).\nAs is fairly obvious to anyone with any experience at all in markets,\ntrades do not occur at constant intervals. To simplify the mathematics, let\u2019sassume we can make a change of timescale so that they do occur at equal\nintervals (this transformation will never be knowable in reality, but con-ceptually we can make a change to this new time\u2014trading time). Now the\nnumber of trades in any interval, N\n/Delta1t, is Poisson distributed with a con-\nstant parameter \u03bb. So in this timescale the expected number of trades, \u03bb,\nper trading time is constant. If the stock is busy, trading time \ufb02ows quickly.If the stock is quiet then trading time is slow.

If we are trading options on a number of differ-ent underlyings, there is a chance that many of our delta risks will offset.\nIf we are prepared to accept correlation risk instead, we can use this to\navoid hedging by aggregating our deltas and hedging market and possibly\nsector risks in index products. Generally there is a trade-off here. An index\nposition is not going to be as good a hedge against our single stock optionpositions as the stocks themselves would be, but we will save on trans-\naction costs because we will only need to hedge residual risk, not every\nindividual risk.\nThe process of aggregation is simple enough in principle. Consider the\nexample where we have a stock A with price S\nA=100, and an index I with\nprice S I=1,000. Also assume that the index has an exchange-traded fund\n(ETF) associated with it, so all of the trading units are comparable. Stock\nA has a beta relative to the index, \u03b2=1.5. This means that if the index\nmoves up 1 percent, A moves by 1.5 percent. If we are long 1,000 deltas of\nA (whether shares or through option deltas) and the index moves 1 percent,\nour pro\ufb01t/loss ratio (P/L) is given by\nP/L=$0.01\u00d7\u03b2\u00d7SA\u00d71,000=$15\u00d7SA=$1,500\nAnd for each unit of the index ETF we hold short, our loss will be\nP/L=\u2212 $0.01 \u00d71000=$10\nSo to be hedged we need to hold a short position of 150 ETFs.

An alternative would be to assume that changes in implied volatil-\nity and realized volatility are correlated perfectly (not a great assumption\nbut not the worst one to start with, either) and then use the result that thevolatility beta is the same as beta.

It is more of a\njudgment call whether we should normalize them. It really comes down to\nweighing the bene\ufb01ts from reduced hedging costs against the errors intro-\nduced by misestimation and the generally unstable nature of the beta fac-tors. Generally, estimating and forecasting beta is even more dif\ufb01cult than\nforecasting volatility (as we have to effectively estimate two volatilities\nand a correlation). When trading options speculatively, we think that wehave an edge in volatility prediction over the market. It probably isn\u2019t wise\nto con\ufb02ate this bet with a more dif\ufb01cult one when trying to save hedging\ncosts, but this trade-off is highly dependent on the particular situation.

Traders who\nare serious about going down this path may want to consider using one\nof the commercially developed factor models such as BARRA or APT to\nquantify their risks.\nThe more conservative method would be to come up with hedging\nbands for each underlying, and then also to keep track of the entire po-sition\u2019s risk in terms of an index or possibly several indexes. This can helpprotect us against the situation where the whole market moves against us\nbut none of our individual positions has reached a point where it should be\nhedged.\nSUMMARY\nTo trade volatility we need to continuously monitor, and periodically ad-\njust, our underlying position. Exactly how we choose to do this will have\na huge effect on our overall pro\ufb01tability. Most of the trading that an op-tion trader does is actually hedging, so it is important to understand the\nprocess.\nrRemember that hedging is designed to remove risk. If you are trying to\ntrade the underlying directionally you are not hedging.rSuccessful hedging removes the most risk for the least cost.rThe Hodges-Neuberger formalism solves this problem in theory but istoo cumbersome to use in practice.\nrThe approximation of Zakamouline is a very good working solution\nthat retains most of the desirable features of the HN method.rThe Whalley-Wilmott approximation is a good rough approximation\nthat can be implemented within many commercially available pricing\nsoftware solutions.rFurther cost reduction can be achieved by aggregating option positions\nacross many different underlyings and managing the residual risk.rDynamic hedging cannot be relied upon. It must be combined withstatic hedging using other options. Only this can offset the risks as-sociated with jumps.\nc04 JWBK128-Sinclair April 11, 2008 14:24 Char Count=\n86\nc05 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:58 Char Count=\nCHAPTER 5\nHedged Option\nPositions\nIn Chapter 1 we stated the central result that\nP/L=vega (\u03c3implied \u2212\u03c3realized ) (5.1)\nActually this is only true on average.

What is really going on here? What will the actual distribu-\ntion of results look like? The central insight in the BSM argument is thatan option can be replicated by trading the underlying. Figure 5.1 shows the\nresults of 100 simulations, where we actually try to replicate this option.\nAs we are long a call, the replicating portfolio should look like a short callposition.\nSo things are approximately what we expect. This indeed looks like\nthe payoff from a short call position struck at 100, with the initial valuecorresponding to a vega of $1,000. But the replication isn\u2019t perfect. There is\nsigni\ufb01cant dispersion around the true value. The dispersion is dependent\non the \ufb01nal underlying price, with the most variability occurring when itexpires near the strike.\nThe \ufb01rst thing to note is that we are not hedging continuously. Dis-\ncrete hedging makes our nondirectional strategy very path dependent (thishas nothing to do with the weak path dependence of American options as\nopposed to European options).

This is just the riskwe take for not hedging in\ufb01nitely often and running up an in\ufb01nite amount\nof trading cost. This variability is unfortunate but we can always reduce it\nc05 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:58 Char Count=\nHedged Option Positions 93\nby hedging more frequently. Note that this is when the underlying follows a\ndiffusive process. If there are jumps, we can\u2019t alleviate the issue by hedging\nmore often. In the real world there are simply some risks we can\u2019t hedge\naway. An equity trader is trading drift but he is also exposed to volatilityrisk and path dependency. Being long a stock that moves smoothly from\n100 to 110 in one-dollar increments is very different to being long a stock\nthat moves from 100 to 110 but dropped to 50 before shooting up. In eachcase the \ufb01nal price does not tell the full story of the risks involved in the\ntrade. We seek to trade volatility, but we also have volatility sampling risk\n(intimately related to the volatility of volatility) and path dependency.\nVOLATILITY DEPENDENCY\nThis analysis has assumed that we were hedging our options at the true\nvolatility. In practice this is unknown and we need to choose a hedging\nvolatility. There are two obvious candidates, \u03c3forecast and\u03c3implied . Which is\nbetter and what consequences are attached to choosing a volatility that will\nalmost certainly not be the same as the realized volatility?\nA simple set of examples shows that the results of this choice are again\nvery path dependent. Consider the two underlying price paths shown inFigure 5.7. These have exactly the same annualized volatility (23.44 per-\ncent) but in one case the price drifts higher and in the other case it does not.\nAssume we buy $1,000 vega of the one-month calls with a strike price\nof 100, at an implied volatility of 18.44 percent, and hedge at the end ofeach day.

(Note that here there will be no sampling-induced errors in the\nP/L because the price path has been exactly constructed rather than gener-ated by a speci\ufb01ed random process.) Table 5.2 shows the P/L possibilities\nwhen we hedge along each path with either the implied volatility or the\nforecast volatility.\nSo obviously the choice matters a great deal, and equally obviously the\nsituation is very path dependent. When the underlying is drifting and weare long gamma, our hedges are going to be losers. We will be selling into a\nrising market. So we want to hedge less often. If we use a higher volatility,\nwe see a lower gamma so we hedge less. Conversely, in a choppy, trend-less market our hedges will tend to be winners, so we want to hedge more\noften. If we use a lower volatility we can gain more gamma. The situation\nis obviously opposite if we are short options. Traders refer to this hedgingtrick as \u201cletting their deltas run\u201d if they are long in a trending market, or\n\u201chedging defensively\u201d if they are short gamma in a trending market. This is\nsummarized in Table 5.3.\nNext we more generally examine the problem of choosing a hedging\nvolatility. We assume we sell an option at an implied volatility, \u03c3\ni, and we\nthen hedge at the realized volatility, \u03c3r. Let\u2019s examine how the P/L of this\nposition evolves through time as we hedge it. This is really just the same ar-\ngument we used in Chapter 1, but now we need to be very careful whether\nwe are evaluating quantities at the implied or realized volatilities. Againour derivation will be informal. Readers interested in mathematical details\nshould consult Carr (1999), Henrard (2003), or Ahmad and Wilmott (2005).\nTABLE 5.3The Direction One Should Bias Volatility for Di\ufb00erent Option\nPositions as a Function of Market Direction\nPosition Market Hedging Volatility Bias\nShort gamma Trending Low\nShort gamma Range bound High\nLong gamma Trending High\nLong gamma Range bound Low\nc05 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:58 Char Count=\nHedged Option Positions 95\nExpression 1.2 gives the value of the hedged portfolio after the \ufb01rst\ntime step.

The pro\ufb01t arrives deter-ministically.\nrThere are no issues with the options supposedly being marked against\nus. Whatever they are marked at, we hedge accordingly.rThis is a viable hedging method even if we don\u2019t know how to forecast\nvolatility very well! If we sell options because our only opinion is that\nimplied volatility is too high, we can still make money.\nIf we take the present value of the one-step pro\ufb01t and then sum over\nall time steps, we arrive at the total P/L for the position:\n1\n2/parenleftbig\n\u03c32\ni\u2212\u03c32\nr/parenrightbig/integraldisplay\nexp(\u2212 rt)S2/Gamma1(\u03c3i)dt (5.16)\nWe can now see the path-dependence effect that we observed in the\nearlier example. Even if our option is initially struck at the money, the drift\nin the underlying will take it away from there until the option\u2019s gamma is\nsmall, and hence the potential pro\ufb01t in equation (5.16) is small. This makes\nc05 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:58 Char Count=\nHedged Option Positions 97\nsense: We are putting on a volatility bet. We only get paid if we assume\nsome volatility risk and if an option is suf\ufb01ciently far from the at-the-money\npoint such that we have no volatility exposure left. This is why traders\nwant to end up near the strike at expiration. The gamma is largest at thatpoint in time and space. If you are correct in your volatility assessment you\nmake the most money there. This is also an argument for trading strangles\nor strips instead of straddles. We want to have a volatility position over awide enough range of the underlying.\nPath dependency is also a reason why different strikes should indeed\ntrade at different implied volatilities. The path the underlying takes hasdifferent effects on options of different strikes because their gamma pro-\n\ufb01le will be very different. Expression (5.16) tells us that the fair implied\nvolatility (the volatility that makes the P/L zero) is gamma dependent. Thisconcept is explored by Dupire (2006) in his work on \u201cbreakeven volatility\nskews.\u201d\nNote that this applies to both long and short gamma positions. This\nmay come as a surprise. Most traders know that it is good for a short po-sition to gently settle near a strike at expiry. However, it is also good for a\nlong position to \ufb01nish at the strike. The difference is that practically hedg-ing the long position becomes next to impossible at very short timescales\nand the only time we can hedge easily is when realized volatility is low (i.e.,\nwe gently settle near our long strike), which means our volatility forecast\nis incorrect. We need to also note that expiring at a strike greatly increases\nthe feedback effects of the dynamic hedging of the market makers. If theyare long gamma, they will all be buying the underlying below the strike and\nselling it above the strike, thus compressing the realized volatility. This\nwill be bad for the option holders, but it is the low volatility that is bad,not being near the strike. Being near the strike can be the cause of the low\nvolatility.\nFigure 5.9 shows \ufb01ve possible paths for the P/L evolution as a function\nof time for an option hedged at implied volatility. This was for the case of ashort position consisting of 1,000 vega of one-year, at-the-money calls, sold\nat a volatility of 40 percent and hedged at the implied volatility until expiry.Drift, rates, and dividend yields were zero.\nFigure 5.9 shows that hedging at the implied volatility gives a smoother\nP/L, but the end result is far more variable than when we hedge at realizedvolatility. Most traders \ufb01nd this a far easier situation to deal with.\nAhmad and Wilmott (2005) found expressions for the expected pro\ufb01t\n(as an integral) and the standard deviation (as a double integral) of an op-\ntion hedged at the implied volatility. The interested reader can refer to\nthese, but it is probably more useful to gain a feel for this situation byrunning simulations (these can also be extended to cover different stochas-\ntic processes, an implied volatility smile, and a position consisting of more\nc05 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:58 Char Count=\n98 VOLATILITY TRADING\n\u20135,00005,00010,00015,00020,00025,000\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nTime (Days)P/L\nFIGURE 5.9 Pro\ufb01t as a Function of Time for a Short Position Hedged at Implied\nVolatility\nthan one option type).

The general case was exam-\nined by Carr (1999) and Henrard (2003), but again, running simulations is\nprobably the easiest way to get a good picture of the situation.\nSUMMARY\nOne of the frustrating things about using options to trade the spread be-\ntween implied volatility and realized volatility is that we can be correct in\nthis prediction and still lose money. Traders need to be aware of why andhow this can happen. Some of the reasons for this disconnect between our\nprediction and our results can be addressed, but we also need to under-\nstand in order to learn. We need to learn from real errors, not try to draw\nlessons from what is essentially just bad luck.\nrHedged option positions are very path dependent.rCorrectly predicting realized volatility is no guarantee of being\npro\ufb01table.rSome variance in P/L can be eliminated by hedging more frequently.rHedging at realized volatility makes our \ufb01nal P/L more certain but verynoisy.\nrHedging at implied volatility smoothes the P/L but makes the \ufb01nal\namount more uncertain.\nc05 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 21:58 Char Count=\n100\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\nCHAPTER 6\nMoney\nManagement\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got a plan until they get hit\u201d\n\u2014Mike Tyson\nMike Tyson once said, \u201cEverybody\u2019s got a plan until they get hit.\u201d\nWhile it is not true that a good money management system can turn\nany trading method into a pro\ufb01table one, it is certainly possible to\nruin even the best value trades with poor money management. Edge esti-\nmation and capture are dif\ufb01cult and both involve subjective judgment. So it\nis probably understandable that traders focus so heavily on these aspects.But money management and trade sizing is just as essential for success. In\nthis chapter we look at the various methods we can use to size trades and\nthe risk/reward characteristics that each choice implies.\nAD HOC SCHEMES\nConsider the equity curves given in Figures 6.1 and 6.2. It seems obvious\nthat the trader in the \ufb01rst \ufb01gure is in some sense better. He has made a\nlot more money in the same period of time, albeit while displaying morevariance.\nActually, in this instance the trades that the traders made were identi-\ncal.

But the \ufb01rst trader \ufb01nished with $5,207 and the\nsecond only accumulated $620. Trade sizing is clearly an important issue.\nThe simplest method is to size according to feel. The trade size is ad-\njusted on an ad hoc basis depending on how good the trader thinks the\nindividual bet is. This is a terrible idea. This isn\u2019t really so very different topicking trades based on feel. Our entire methodology is based on the idea\nthat we can systematically approach the trading process, and to size our\ntrades according to hunches goes completely against this. It will let us fallvictim to our moods and psychological biases: precisely what we are trying\nto avoid.\n0100200300400500600700\n1,001 901 801 701 601 501 401 301 201 101 1\nNumber of TradesCumulative P/L\nFIGURE 6.2 Equity Curve for a Trader Betting $5 on Each Trade\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\nMoney Management 103\nThe next step is to trade the same amount every time. For example, we\nmight choose to always trade 100 options or 1,000 vega. This is known as\na\ufb01xed trade size system. Any system that can \ufb01nd value will be pro\ufb01table\n(over the long run) with such a sizing scheme. In back-testing this is often\nthe sizing scheme used, as it most clearly shows the pro\ufb01tability of the\nunderlying method.\nOr we could choose to trade a constant percentage of our bankroll at\neach opportunity. This is known as a \ufb01xed fraction sizing system.\nOur coin toss example was for just one group of 1,000 bets. Figures 6.3a\nthrough c show the results for another three trials. We can see two things.\nFirst, even though in all cases we have the same mathematical edge (a\n55 percent chance of winning an even money bet) the results vary wildly.\nSecond, the choice of bet size makes a huge difference. Proportional bet-ting sometimes results in vastly greater \ufb01nal wealth and can never go to\nzero (at least in the idealized case we consider here where we have in-\n\ufb01nitely divisible currency units), but looks to be a lot more volatile in itsresults than \ufb01xed betting.\nThis numerical experiment has clearly shown that the choice of a stak-\ning plan is important. In addition to the two schemes just mentioned, thereare a number of others we could dream up, such as betting so that all suc-\ncessful bets would win the same amount, increasing bets (either by abso-\nlute size or relative size) after a win, or adopting a similar strategy where\nwe increase bet size after a loss. With all these schemes there will be pa-\nrameters we need to choose, such as what percentage of our bankroll tostart betting with. How can we decide between all the alternatives? A pos-\nsible solution to this problem was found by John Kelly (Kelly 1956).\nTHE KELLY CRITERION\nConsider a general situation such that when we win we gain wpercent, and\nwhen we lose we lose l percent. Our bankroll is initially W 0. Each bet is a\nset fraction, f, of the bankroll.\nSo after a win our bankroll is\nW0(1+fw) (6.1)\nOr we can say that the gain factor is (1+fw). Similarly, a loss would leave\nus with\nW0(1\u2212fw) (6.2)\nSo the gain factor here is (1 \u2212fl). More simply, each time we win we mul-\nt i p l yb y( 1+ fw) and when we lose we multiply by (1 \u2212fl).

On any \ufb01nite num-\nber of bets, our expected return would be maximized by betting our entire\nbankroll each time. Sadly, this also gives us a 100 percent chance of go-\ning bankrupt, as eventually we are bound to lose. This strategy takes no\naccount of risk.\nWe actually want to maximize our risk-adjusted return or utility. This\ninvolves choosing a particular utility function again. Generally the log util-ity function is chosen (we could choose any one of a number of utility\nfunctions but the log function can be shown to do better in the long run\nthan any other). In this case we will not be maximizing expected wealth but\nwe will be maximizing typical wealth. This distinction is important. The\naverage value would be heavily distorted by the unlikely case where thetrader wins every trade. This won\u2019t be of great consolation to the traderswho have gone bankrupt. By maximizing the logarithm of expected wealth\nwe eliminate the possibility of bankruptcy.\nSo we take the log of the gain function and \ufb01nd the optimal fby differ-\nentiating with respect to xand then setting this equal to zero. This gives\nf=(pw\u2212ql)\nwl(6.5)\n(So in our initial simple example the Kelly fraction would have been 0.1.)\nOur expected bankroll after Nbets would be given by\nW=W0(1+pln(1+fw)+qln(1\u2212fl))N(6.6)\nFigure 6.4 shows the expected bankroll for 10 bets as a function of bet\nsize where wins pay twice as much as the losses and we win 45 percent of\nbets. The Kelly ratio in this case is 0.175, which corresponds to the peakof the curve. Betting more than twice Kelly turns the growth rate negative\nand our bankroll becomes more depleted as we bet bigger.\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\n106 VOLATILITY TRADING\n\u20130.200.20.40.60.811.21.41.6\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nBet SizeBankroll\nFIGURE 6.4 Expected Bankroll for 10 Bets as a Function of Bet Size\nThe Excel spreadsheet \u201cTrade Sizing.xls\u201d shows portfolio growth for\nvarious \ufb01xed-proportion bets as well as the optimal bet size derived from\nthe Kelly criterion.

Betting more than Kelly results inhigher volatility and lower returns. This can be seen in Figure 6.5, wherewe show one realization of a P/L curve for the coin-tossing game when\nusing half Kelly, full Kelly, and twice Kelly bet sizes.\nAt this point let\u2019s just assume that the Kelly strategy is suf\ufb01ciently\nintriguing to make it worthwhile considering a more realistic situation,one that is closer to those we might encounter when trading \ufb01nancial\ninstruments.\nWe need to generalize the situation to deal with a continuous outcome.\nImagine trading a situation where the outcome of a bet or trade is knownto have a certain distribution.

It is some-\ntimes incorrectly stated that the Kelly criterion only applies to trades with\nbinary outcomes. This is untrue. However, in the case of binary events,certain simpli\ufb01cations can be made. These approximations do indeed have\nlimited applicability. In general this equation is too unwieldy to use di-\nrectly, but if we consider the case where our edge per trade is small we canmake things simpler (and, sadly, this case usually is fairly representative of\nreality). In this situation we know that fwill be small and we can expand\nequation (6.12) in a power series, then truncate after leading order to get\n0\u2248/integraldisplay\ng(x)/Phi1(x)[1\u2212fg(x)+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ]dx\n=/integraldisplay\ng(x)/Phi1(x)dx\u2212f/integraldisplay\ng\n2(x)/Phi1(x)dx+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 (6.13)\nBut the \ufb01rst term is just the expected payoff for a unit bet and the\nsecond term is the variance of the payoff, g(x). So in the limit of small edge\nwe obtain\nf=r\n\u03c32(6.14)\nThis is certainly simple enough to use. To estimate our trading size we\nneed only the expected return of the trade and its variance, no matter howcomplicated the actual trade is. Actually, the return here should generally\nbe interpreted as the return over the risk-free rate. Many derivations ne-glect to mention this. (Those aimed at gamblers probably neglect it as it is\ndif\ufb01cult to earn interest while sitting at a blackjack table, and bookmakers\ntend not to pay interest either.)\nThe expected growth rate for someone trading at a fraction, f,o ft h e\nKelly ratio is given by\nGR=/parenleftbigg\nf\u2212f\n2\n2/parenrightbiggr2\n\u03c32(6.15)\nwhich is maximized for f=1: trading at the full Kelly ratio when the growth\nrate is\nGR max=r2\n2\u03c32(6.16)\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\nMoney Management 109\nAnd we see that the growth rate is zero for f=0, the case where\nwe don\u2019t trade at all; and for f=2, when we drastically overbet. As the\ngrowth rate is symmetric around f=1 we can see it is better to bet more\nconservatively and hence to underestimate our edge (or, equivalently, to\noverestimate our variance) as we will obtain the same growth for f=\n1\u2013x andf=1+x.\nIf we are trading according to the Kelly criterion, the probability that\nwe reach a bankroll B\u00d7W>W0before we dip to A\u00d7W<W0is given by\nP(A,B)=1\u2212A1\u22122\nf\nB1\u22122\nf\u2212A1\u22122\nf(6.17)\nIt is interesting that the edge and variance of the trade don\u2019t appear\nhere. Having a better trade just speeds up the process. If A=0.5 and\nB=2w eg e tP (A,B )=2/3. Conversely, this means that when betting at\nfull Kelly you have a one-third chance of having your bankroll halve beforeit doubles! As we saw in our earlier simulations, Kelly sizing is exceedingly\nvolatile. To deal with these extreme drawdowns it is reasonably common\nfor Kelly devotees to trade at a fraction of the Kelly ratio. Table 6.1 showshow the probability of halving before doubling can be changed by using a\nfractional Kelly ratio.\nReducing drawdowns by trading at a fraction of the Kelly ratio is not a\nfree lunch.

But it is actually possible to calculate the entire proba-\nbility distribution of our future bankroll. A nice paper by Chapman (2007)\nshows how the bankroll spreads through time.

The peak of the probability distribution function (PDF)\nis less than 1.

Thisis not the case for progression type methodologies where current trade\nsizes are a function of previous trade sizes. Myopia is very useful when\ndeciding if a strategy is practically useable.\nrTrading a fraction of the Kelly amount allows us to easily tune our\ndesired level of risk at the expense of lower expected returns.\nBad Points\nrWhen betting a fraction of wealth, a loss followed by a win still leaves\nus behind.rThe amount bet becomes extremely large in situations where we havea large amount of edge\u2014in other words, when the probability of a winis high or the risk is very low.\nrProbability estimation becomes crucial. Overinvesting based on over-estimation of success likelihood will lead to disaster.\nrThe total amount of money invested is far larger than the winnings.rDue to the strategy\u2019s very volatile outcomes, it is possible to have ses-sions with very poor outcomes even though the long-term expectationsare high.\nrThe time necessary for the long run to dominate can be very longindeed.\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\nMoney Management 113\nrSometimes it isn\u2019t obvious what bankroll is. It certainly isn\u2019t haircut.\nThe haircut is the amount we need to post at our clearing \ufb01rm, but it\ncertainly is not the amount you are able to lose. Generally it is better\nto think of bankroll as the amount you can lose before the strategy isabandoned. But sometimes this isn\u2019t clear, either. This was studied by\nLeib (1995), who pointed out that amateur blackjack players should\nbet much more aggressively than professionals, as the amateurs couldreplenish their bankrolls from their other income. This concept also\napplies to traders who can switch jobs.\nWe all know we need to be patient when trading. This is often axiomat-\nically stated as a virtue. We tend to say re\ufb02exively that we possess patience\nbecause we are so acutely aware that it is necessary for a good trader, buthow patient do we need to be to reap the bene\ufb01ts of the Kelly strategy?\nAn example from Browne (2000) shows that waiting for the long\nrun can be more tedious than we might reasonably expect. He considersan investor who has a choice between a stock with an annual return of\n15 percent and a volatility of 30 percent, and an interest bearing account\nthat pays 7 percent. The Kelly criterion (equation 6.14) has us invest 89\npercent of our wealth [0.15 \u22120.07/(0.3)\n2] in the stock and put the remain-\nder in the bank. Before we will have a 95 percent probability of beating\nthe all-cash portfolio by 10 percent we have to wait 157 years. Even worse,\nin order to have a 95 percent probability of beating the all-stock portfolio\nby 10 percent we have to wait 10,286 years. Even the expected times tooutperform these benchmarks is 2.8 years and 184 years.\n1Patience is\nindeed necessary.\nALTERNATIVES TO THE KELLY CRITERION\nSo is what Kelly does really what a trader wants? As always, the answer is,\u201cIt depends.\u201d What externally imposed constraints does he face? In a per-\nsonal account where no one else can stop him out due to a drawdown, a\ntrader may be happy to use Kelly and tune the volatility by trading a fractionof the full Kelly ratio. Similarly, when we are making an enormous number\nof trades in a short period we may accept a Kelly-based sizing method, as\nwe can be more con\ufb01dent that the long run will arrive soon enough to over-whelm any variance effects. But when trading in an institutional setting or\nwhen being backed by someone else, the Kelly criterion is probably not re-\nally aligned with the interest of the trader. Here a trader isn\u2019t as interested\n1The expected time for Kelly to outperform another strategy with a trading fraction\nf\u2019by\u03b5percent is given by2\n\u03c32(f\u2212f/prime)2ln(1+\u03b5).\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\n114 VOLATILITY TRADING\nin optimal long-term growth as he is in a better chance of making a pro\ufb01t.\nHe will trade maximal long-term potential for more certain short-term\npro\ufb01ts.\nWe said earlier that Kelly was expected to outperform other strate-\ngies, so what can the trader do that is better? He can gain a more certainshort-term pro\ufb01t by giving up the impossibility of ever going broke. (When\ntrading according to Kelly or any fractional money management scheme wecan never go broke. However, this is really a theoretical point because most\ntraders will get \ufb01red as quickly for turning in a 90 percent drawdown as a\n100 percent drawdown.) To see the general principle behind this trade-offwe now look at Oscar\u2019s system, a progressive betting system \ufb01rst devised\nby a craps player in the 1950s (Wilson 1965).\nA progressive betting system can never turn a negative edge into a pos-\nitive edge. There is no magic. But the sizing algorithm can change certainaspects of the payout schedule. We have already seen this. The fractional\nKelly system traded lower returns for smaller drawdowns. Oscar wantedsomething entirely different. He just wanted every weekend he spent in\nLas Vegas to end with a small win. So he devised a progression that works\nexceedingly well in the short run.\nThere are two general types of betting progressions: positive progres-\nsions and negative progressions. With a positive progression, the generalidea is that you raise your bets after wins. This means that your bigger bets\nare primarily funded by prior pro\ufb01ts. The Kelly scheme is an example of a\npositive progression.\nWith a negative progression, the general theory is that you raise your\nbets after losses. This attempt to get back to even more quickly is moredangerous, since an untimely run of losses can bankrupt you very quickly.However, these schemes are seductive in that they allow you to win after\na session in which you\u2019ve lost more bets than you\u2019ve won. Since your bets\nafter losses are bigger bets, you don\u2019t have to win so many of them to comeback. The other result is that you lose so many consecutive bets that you\ngo broke.\nMany attempts have been made to combine the best features of these\nsystems. Oscar\u2019s system was one. Oscar wanted to win just one unit. Eachsession started with a one unit bet. If it won he stopped. If he lost, the next\nbet was the same size (so we take more risk than with Kelly because ourbets as a percentage of our bankroll grow as we lose). After a win, the next\nbet would be one unit higher than the last. No bet would ever be so large\nthat it would take us over the target.\nThis system has been analyzed in detail, \ufb01rst by Wilson and then\nmore extensively by Ethier (1996). The probability of success is shown inTable 6.2.\nThe problem is that in the rare instances that things go badly, they go\nhorrendously badly. According to Wilson, in the 1960s Julian Braun ran a\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\nMoney Management 115\nTABLE 6.2The Probability of Reaching a Pro\ufb01t Target of One Unit before\nHaving to Quit When Using Oscar\u2019s System, as a Function of the Win\nProbability for a Single Trial, p, and the House Limit M\nMp =9/19 p=244/495 p=1/2\n50 0.99078112 0.99620367 0.99734697\n100 0.99464246 0.99841219 0.99904342\n150 0.99587158 0.99902785 0.99947577\n200 0.99646866 0.99930553 0.99965833\n250 0.99681764 0.99946077 0.99975501\n300 0.99704404 0.99955895 0.99981337\n350 0.99720107 0.99962624 0.99985174\ncomputer simulation of Oscar\u2019s system. He assumed the house had a bet-\nting limit of 500 units and that the probability of success for each bet was\n244/495 (consistent with craps). In 280,000 trials there were 66 disasters\nwhere the gambler bumped up against the house limit. Those situations lostan average of 13,000 units. So the laws of mathematics can\u2019t be cheated, but\nwe can choose to push the disasters into the future rather than experience\nthem continuously. To a certain degree, you can choose when to take your(inevitable) losses.\nThe situation for traders is different. Here we have a positive expec-\ntation. But we would still like to perform a similar trick to Oscar and\nsomewhat smooth our stream of pro\ufb01ts. We would also like to reduce our\ndependency on the long run. This was the problem addressed by Browne(1999, 2000). Speci\ufb01cally he found the dynamic strategy that maximized the\nprobability of reaching a given wealth level in a speci\ufb01ed time. He shows\nthat the optimal fraction to invest with time Tleft to reach the goal Bwhen\ncurrent wealth is W, is given by\nf\n\u2217=1\n\u03c3\u221a\nTBexp(\u2212rT)\nWn/parenleftbigg\nN\u22121/parenleftbiggWexp(rT)\nB/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg\n(6.20)\nwhere\nn(x)=1\u221a\n2\u03c0exp/parenleftbigg\u2212x2\n2/parenrightbigg\n(6.21a)\nN(x)=x/integraldisplay\n=\u221en(z)dz (6.21b)\nris the interest rate.\nBrowne shows that this sizing strategy is equivalent to the hedging\nstrategy of a binary call. This argument is insightful and should help\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\n116 VOLATILITY TRADING\noption traders get a feel for the behavior of the strategy. It may also help us\nthink of ideas for generalizing the argument to more realistic scenarios, for\nexample where we have a stop placed on our bankroll as well as a target\non the upside.\nIf we have a stock that evolves according to our normal model of ge-\nometric Brownian motion (GBM), the value of an option that pays Bif we\nare above the strike, K,a tt i m e T, is given by\nC=Bexp(\u2212r(T\u2212t))N/parenleftBigg\nln/parenleftbigS\nK/parenrightbig\n+/parenleftbig\nr\u22121\n2\u03c32/parenrightbig\n(T\u2212t)\n\u03c3\u221aT\u2212t/parenrightBigg\n(6.22)\n(Haug 2007b).

If we were actually short the option,\nour aim would be to hedge it so that we maximized the probability thatwe could pay off the claim at expiry. Or, at any given time, our wealth isgiven by the expression in equation (6.22) and we need to maximize the\nprobability that our terminal wealth is given by B. The optimal policy in\nsuch a case is given by equation (6.20), here with wealth x=C(t,S). Making\nthis substitution we obtain\nf\n\u2217=/Delta1S (6.24)\nSo this strategy is indeed equivalent to the hedging strategy of the dig-\nital call where we consider the stock price to be our wealth, W. Figures 6.9\nand 6.10 show the difference between this dynamic sizing strategy and the\nconstant Kelly strategy. This assumes that we are trading a stock with a\ndrift of 22 percent, an annualized volatility of 45 percent, and there is also\na risk-free rate of 8 percent. In this case the Kelly ratio is 0.6914. Our goal isto make 50 percent in a session of 100 trading days (not completely unrea-\nsonable, but very optimistic given the drift and volatility of the underlying).\nWe can see that initially the Browne strategy is much more aggressive. Weknow that our goal requires us to take signi\ufb01cant risk. Initially we trade at\na leverage of 1.8, three times the leverage of the Kelly strategy. But as we\nget closer to our goal we signi\ufb01cantly dial down the risk. In practice wewould continually monitor our goals and make adjustments (this process\nis discussed in Chapter 7).\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\nMoney Management 117\n6080100120140160180\n1\n7\n1319253137\n43\n49\n5561\n67\n73\n79\n85\n91\n97 Trading DaysWealthKelly\nBrowne\nFIGURE 6.9 The Wealth Accumulated When Following the Browne and Kelly\nStrategies\nBrowne also shows that the expected time for this strategy to beat any\nother is given by\nT=/bracketleftBigg\nN\u22121(1\u2212\u03b1)\u2212N\u22121/parenleftbig1\n1\u2212\u03b5/parenrightbig\n\u03c3(f\u2212f/prime)/bracketrightBigg2\n(6.25)\nSo now we can compare", "doc_id": "892dbfc2-084e-4353-96b0-a5c0f9cf256b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e56e60bc22dfca8d608ff33242b7435196fe75db3b6caf2bc8e8739bcf629172", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 221126, "end": 234222}, "relationships": {"1": "cba938a9-dc3f-413e-8698-8075f9677354", "2": "2402d778-6823-4c54-ac86-8d93313ef091", "3": "c5a13c60-4ce5-406f-9ad8-c2fcc93b999b"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5a13c60-4ce5-406f-9ad8-c2fcc93b999b": {"text": "practice wewould continually monitor our goals and make adjustments (this process\nis discussed in Chapter 7).\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\nMoney Management 117\n6080100120140160180\n1\n7\n1319253137\n43\n49\n5561\n67\n73\n79\n85\n91\n97 Trading DaysWealthKelly\nBrowne\nFIGURE 6.9 The Wealth Accumulated When Following the Browne and Kelly\nStrategies\nBrowne also shows that the expected time for this strategy to beat any\nother is given by\nT=/bracketleftBigg\nN\u22121(1\u2212\u03b1)\u2212N\u22121/parenleftbig1\n1\u2212\u03b5/parenrightbig\n\u03c3(f\u2212f/prime)/bracketrightBigg2\n(6.25)\nSo now we can compare this strategy to Kelly\u2019s results given earlier.\nThe results are shown in Table 6.3.\n00.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.82\n1\n6\n111621\n3136414651566166717681869196Trading DaysBrowne Ratio and Goal LikelihoodBrowne ratio\nProb of Success\nFIGURE 6.10 The Browne Ratio and the Probability of Reaching the Goal\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\n118 VOLATILITY TRADING\nTABLE 6.3Time Needed for Browne\u2019s Strategy to Beat Competing Strategies by\n10 Percent\nBankruptcy Probability Time to Beat Cash Time to Beat Stock\nby 10% (years) by 10% (years)\n0.05 1.3 85\n0.01 14 900\n0.001 43 2,780\n0.0001 73 4,774\nThese numbers are far better than for the Kelly strategy.

Either we have had an\nopportunity to place a single trade/bet and see how it fares, or we havehad the opportunity to invest in an asset with \ufb01xed drift and volatility. A\nmore realistic situation is one where the parameters we are interested in\nare changing. In particular we saw in Chapter 3 that implied volatility is amean-reverting process. What are the implications of this for trade sizing?\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\nMoney Management 119\nConsider a very simple example. Imagine we again have a chance to\nplace a bet that will win 55 percent of the time and pay even money. We\nknow the Kelly ratio here is 0.1 so we bet 10 percent of our bankroll. Now,\nbefore the bet is settled, the odds change so that we are paid 1.2 times asmuch for a win as we lose if we are wrong. Under these conditions the\nKelly ratio is 0.175 so we would opt to increase our bet as the conditions\nare now much more favorable to us. Essentially we now have a position atan average payoff of between 1 and 1.2, but when the second bet is placed\nwe had to take into account that our bankroll was smaller as a result of\nplacing the \ufb01rst bet.\nWe will see that trading a mean-reverting process is similar. As the de-\nviations from fair value get larger we will do more of the trade. This leads tothe rule of thumb: When in trouble, double. But this is true only to a point.In a continuous trading setting, as we get better and better prices we will\nbe losing money on the position we have already established. Eventually\nthese losses will have depleted our bankroll to the point where we actu-ally want to have a smaller position. This is consistent with how market\nmakers are told to size their trades when they have things pushed against\nthem. The old rule would have a market maker sell 100 at his \ufb01rst level,\nthen back up and sell 200 at the next level, back up again, and sell 300 at\nthe next level. But if things get pushed further from fair value he wouldstart to buy the position back. This isn\u2019t necessarily because his estimate\nof what is fair might have changed (although by this point it probably will\nhave done so), but because he has lost money and the short 600 lot positionis too large a function of his new account size.\nWe will set up a simple model that captures the basic features of what\nwe are trading, and try to generalize the Kelly argument. The simplestmean-reverting model is the single-parameter Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,\ngoverned completely by its speed of reversion, \u00b5. Also let\u2019s assume for sim-\nplicity that we have normalized the underlying, S, so it has a mean of zero\nand a standard deviation of 1.\ndS=\u2212\u00b5Sdt+/radicalbig\n2\u00b5dZ (6.27)\nAs with GBM, these asset paths look very noisy, and just looking at\nthem would be a very bad way to estimate the true reversion speed. Ac-tually, visual inspection wouldn\u2019t even be enough to see that these were\nmean-reverting.

To some ex-\ntent this can be partially managed by careful choice of W0(where we will\napply partial instead of full Kelly). But a further danger exists here. We have\nassumed that the process is governed by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\nwith normal innovations. The real processes we deal with in \ufb01nance willgenerally have fatter tails than implied by the normal distribution. Things\nwill not work so well in this case. Figures 6.14 and 6.15 show the results of\na trading session where the distribution is logistic rather than normal. Theimportant difference between this example and that of Figures 6.12 and\n6.13 is that here we have an excess kurtosis of 9.

So in addition to\nthe larger proportion of large moves we can also expect more small moves.\nThis would seem to suggest modifying the strategy by trading more ag-gressively when entering, looking for small moves, and then exiting more\nquickly when things move against us. Simulations seem to support this.\nIt is important to emphasize the dangerous game we are playing here.\nThis theory shows that when trading a mean-reverting process we should(at \ufb01rst) add to our position as it goes against us. This clearly can be dan-\ngerous. The danger has nothing to do with such unsupported rules as \u201cOnlylosers add to losers.\u201d In fact, the theory shows that the optimal trading rule\nin this instance is to add to losers. Further, this rule can be enunciated,\ntested, and modi\ufb01ed in a way that vague general assertions cannot.\nThe real danger is that the system may fundamentally change so that\nthe mean we will eventually revert to is totally different to the one westarted with. This is why we need to fundamentally evaluate why the ini-tial trade has gone against us. Imagine we are short a stock at 20 percent\nvolatility because we think the fair value is 13 percent. If it gets choppy be-\ncause a few large orders enter the market on an otherwise slow day and im-\nplied volatility rises to 22 percent, we are probably justi\ufb01ed in selling more.\nHowever, consider the example of Interoil Corporation (IOC). At 2:00\nP.M. EST on June 26, 2007, huge sell orders hit the market and drove the\nstock price down from $40.20 to $26.50. There was no news about the com-\npany on any of the major newswires. July implied volatility jumped fromabout 94 percent to 120 percent. In this case a fundamental revaluation of\nthe company had occurred. We had no news or analysis to consider, and\nhuge volume was being transacted (6 million shares in an hour in a stockwith an average daily volume of 600,000). In this case, to sell more volatility\nwould be foolhardy and irresponsible. So each case needs to be considered\nin context.\nThis is obviously an area where experience of a particular market can\nbe an asset. But there is a good way to use experience and a bad way. Thegood way is to use your knowledge defensively. You should actively lookfor things that are out of place with what you have seen in the past and then\nbe extra cautious. The bad way is to over\ufb01t to past data. If you have never\nseen deviations as large before, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that this is\nthe best trade you have ever done. It could well mean your past experience\nis now irrelevant.\nSelling a rising market and buying a falling market is the replication\nstrategy for a short option. In Chapter 2 we saw that forecast volatilityis generally below implied volatility. Part of the reason for this was thatin selling implied volatility we were selling insurance against events that\nhave never occurred before. That is also the case when scaling into any\nc06 JWBK128-Sinclair April 8, 2008 11:13 Char Count=\n124 VOLATILITY TRADING\nmean-reverting asset. You have to be very aware of this and be prepared to\nstop scaling in, even when it can look better than it ever has before.\nA Simple Approximation\nIn practice it will generally be dif\ufb01cult, or even impossible, to maintain theperfect level of positioning. Illiquidity, transaction costs, noncontinuous\ntrading, position limits, and order entry restrictions mean that at best we\nwill need to use equation (6.28) as a guide. It might also be helpful to have adiscrete rule to guide us in putting on the \ufb01rst portion of the position. Let\u2019s\ntry a simple argument for maximizing our total pro\ufb01t given, that we have\nto choose one point for entering the trade.\nIn this toy model we assume that the deviations of the asset price from\nits mean value are normally distributed and independent. So at any timewe just draw a number from a normal distribution to \ufb01nd the deviation,and this is independent of the previous values. For a normally distributed\nprocess, the probability at any time that we have deviated by more than S\nfrom the mean is just the integral of the process.

We look at a trading simulation on the spreadsheet \u201cVIX\nentry test.xls.\u201d We know this is a mean-reverting process. Here we follow\na simple Bollinger band rule. We buy or sell the VIX after it has deviated\nby a certain amount from its moving average. As can be seen, the deviation\nfrom the simple moving average is somewhat normal looking but clearlyis fat-tailed and skewed. We could address the skewness issue by having\ndifferent bands for buying and selling, but that is not the point of this ex-\nercise. This is not meant to be a realistic trading idea. It is just intendedto show that equation (6.29) has some applicability to a situation that we\nknow does not follow the necessary simplifying assumptions.\nWe can see in Figure 6.17 that the peak of the P/L function is very\nclose to the theoretical point of 0.75 standard deviations.

It is quite possible to turn a sensi-ble trading idea into a losing operation by poor sizing decisions. There is nomagic about the process. While \ufb01nancial markets often produce outcomes\nthat are not easy to reconcile with the standard sizing models, understand-\ning the assumptions and result of these models can show us what we needto bear in mind.\nrBefore you can choose a money management scheme you must be veryclear what you are trying to accomplish. Your monetary goals, time\nconstraints, and maximum tolerable drawdowns need to be fully spec-\ni\ufb01ed in advance.\nrWhen there is more edge, trade bigger.rWhen there is more variance or uncertainty, trade smaller.rThe Kelly scheme will eventually overwhelm all others.rThe Browne scheme is useful for hitting speci\ufb01c targets.rWhen trading volatility we have to be prepared to do more as a tradeinitially goes against us.\nrAdding arbitrary price-based stops to a trading system is a poor idea.We should exit our trades when we are wrong. Having volatility moveagainst us may not indicate that we are wrong at all.\nrA good rule of thumb is that a trade should be big enough that thepro\ufb01ts mean something, but not so big that the losses are catastrophic.If this optimum size can\u2019t be found, the trade probably doesn\u2019t have\nenough edge to begin with.\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\nCHAPTER 7\nTrade Evaluation\nYogi Berra was alleged to have said, \u201cIn theory there is no difference\nbetween theory and practice. In practice there is.\u201d The practical dif-\n\ufb01culties of implementing our trading ideas will only become obvi-\nous, and hence become problems that we can address, if we keep detailed\nrecords.\nIt is always important for a trader to track the results of his trades,\nbut it is especially important when using options to trade volatility. We willbe using an instrument, an option, to trade a parameter, volatility. As we\nsaw in Chapter 5, it is quite possible to predict realized volatility correctlyyet still lose money on the hedged option position because of path depen-\ndence. This is not the case when trading stocks or futures. In those cases,\nif we correctly predict direction we will almost certainly realize a pro\ufb01t.\nBut if we do not carefully keep records of our trades, it will be impossible\nto decide if we have been lucky or if we have really discovered a sourceof edge. You need to know exactly how well you have done in order to do\nthings better.\nWithout accurate and comprehensive records it is very easy to fall vic-\ntim to selective memory biases. We all tend to remember the few big winsand big losses. But these are unlikely to be typical of our trading, and bas-\ning decisions on how these trades alone worked out would be very unwise.Trading is largely about making solid, unspectacular plays\u2014precisely the\nones that we tend to forget. For each trading idea or strategy we have we\nshould keep a tally of results, even if it is just a minor adjustment like bi-asing our hedging strategy toward the long side because we are concerned\nabout a stock being a takeover target.\n127\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n128 VOLATILITY TRADING\nMany times we hear something like, \u201cIt is too hard to know exactly\nwhere my pro\ufb01ts come from because so many things interact.\u201d Merely stat-\ning that the problem is hard is no excuse not to try. Tracking results is not\nas enjoyable or as glamorous as \ufb01nding new trades but it is just as essentialto a successful operation.\nGENERAL PLANNING PROCEDURES\nIt is a good practice to set aside a certain time (for equity options the\nMonday after expiry is a good time) to go through all aspects of your trad-\ning operation. One aspect of orthodox economic theory with which tradersshould have no problem is that improvements must be made at the margin;\nwe must constantly strive to improve all aspects of our businesses from\nclearing arrangements to brokerage rates, software, hardware, data feeds,and so on. Make it a set event every month to write down each part of\nthe trading operation and think about whether any aspect could be im-\nproved. Generally nothing will come up, but the world changes quickly. Inthe past year we have changed our execution software, our data feeds, and\nour hedging strategy. None of these changes would be enough to get ex-\ncited over on their own, but this process is essential if one wants to staycompetitive.\nDuring this review we should also establish and review performance\nbenchmarks. Overall performance benchmarking is really in the hands of\nthe capital providers, but during the year it is up to each trader to monitor\nthese and assess progress toward them. It is necessary to establish threelevels of achievement:\n1.Success. What level of return is necessary for the period to be judged\nan unquali\ufb01ed success?\n2.Respectability. What return would be deemed adequate but unex-\nceptional? Operating at this level should not lead to much doubtabout the overall validity of the trading operation but would in-\ndicate that incremental improvements and continuing diligence are\nnecessary.\n3.Failure. What level of performance would lead to the operation being\nstopped out?\nFor example, we might initially set the parameters of a new opera-\ntion as follows. In the \ufb01rst year we want to make $1 million on an average\nhaircut of $1 million. Returns of between $400,000 and $800,000 would be\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\nTrade Evaluation 129\nacceptable and would give us the go-ahead to continue. If we lost $400,000\nwe would liquidate all positions and reevaluate the idea.\nHow do we arrive at these goals? After all, it would be wildly unrealistic\nfor a long-only equity trader who is trading a stock with a typical drift of10 percent per year and an annualized volatility of 30 percent to expect to\nmake a 100 percent return. Before we set our goals, we need to realistically\nevaluate our own skill and the opportunities available to us.\nThe bottom line is important. At the end of the year, the total net pro\ufb01t\nwill determine how much we get paid. Trading is all about pro\ufb01ts. It doesn\u2019tmatter what used to happen, what you think should happen, what an ana-\nlyst tells you is happening, what is in the business pages, or what the talkingheads on TV say. It is entirely about making money. However, over a short\ntime period, pro\ufb01tability is a very crude evaluation of how good we are and\nis also very unlikely to be a good predictor of how well we are likely toperform in the future. Our goals and improvement plans must be based on\nmore discriminating information.\nTotal pro\ufb01t (or loss) can\u2019t tell us how to do better. An athletics coach\nwould not tell his charges to \u201crun faster\u201d and expect them to improve. Theyalready know they need to run faster. They need to know how. In the same\nway, we know we need to make more money. We also need to know how.So results are all that matter but we can only improve results by focusing\non process.\nThere is also a group of traders who are strangely in denial about where\ntheir pro\ufb01ts come from. For instance, a market maker may be insistent thatall of his positions make money or, if he is a little more self-deprecating,\nthat his positions are a scratch. Many beginning traders would rather be\nright than pro\ufb01table, and it seems like this is an aspect of the same phe-\nnomenon. For some reason, collecting the bid/ask spread or being paidfor taking order \ufb02ow isn\u2019t enough. This attitude can only be a hindrance.\nIf we don\u2019t know where our money comes from we can\u2019t improve our\nresults.\nFor each underlying security we trade, we need to keep records of at\nleast the following information:\nrAverage daily pro\ufb01t or loss, both gross and net of fees, commissions,and brokerage.\nrHaircut being used.rPercentage of days that are winners or losers.rSize of average winning daysrSize of average losing days. (Successful trades will tend to have certainsimilarities. For example, your successful short volatility trades mayaverage 75 percent winning days when held to expiration. Knowing\nthese numbers will also help you avoid stopping yourself out of losing\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n130 VOLATILITY TRADING\nlong volatility positions. How long do you typically need to wait for\nyour predicted explosion?)rMaximum win and loss. This is more a measure of the scariness of thetrade. And remember that the largest loss you have seen so far isn\u2019tnecessarily as bad as it can get. Can you cope with this?\nrCumulative pro\ufb01t and loss of the trade to date.rMaximum drawdown, both magnitude and duration.\nThis captures a path dependency of our pro\ufb01t and loss (P/L) that can-\nnot be seen from just the histogram of the daily returns. It is important to\nknow how many losing days in a row is typical because these are the most\ntrying times to work through. Being able to look at similar periods from thepast is very helpful in reassuring yourself that your current misery is really\nnot (necessarily) a sign of doom.\nAlso remember that whenever you are in a drawdown (and you will\nseldom be at the peak of your equity curve) you are not getting paid. Youdo not get paid for periods where you are recovering from drawdowns.\nOnly incremental performance counts. So you and your capital providersshould be more concerned about drawdowns than any other performance\nmeasure. As a very rough rule of thumb, and this is dependent on numer-\nous variables, a 10 percent drawdown will cause marketing issues and a 30percent drawdown starts to raise questions of survival. However, draw-\ndowns are a fact of life. They are one reason why the money manage-\nment procedures need to be addressed before trading starts. Being in a\nhole is always bad, but it is at least nice to have a predetermined plan for\ngetting out.\nThe issue of which costs to include in our analysis deserves some\nthought. What is the point of this whole exercise? If it is to show customershow their investment in a fund has performed, then all costs and expensesneed to be accounted for. But if it is to decide whether a new idea is worth\npursuing, then including of\ufb01ce expenses doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.

You may love tradingexpiry, and this may have caused you to believe you have a signi\ufb01cant edge\nduring that period. But this may be colored by your enjoyment of the busy\ntrading. The numbers will tell you one way or the other. You may actu-ally be better off aggressively \ufb02attening your front-month position before\nexpiration and concentrating on implementing new longer-dated trades\ninstead.\nAlso realize that not all people are equally suited to trading all things.\nSome people need the regular wins that being short volatility can provide,while others are contrary enough to thrive on the long losing periods andhuge wins that come from being long volatility. It is often said that a good\ntrader should be equally adept at trading from either the long or the short\nside. While this might be the ideal, it is very unlikely that this is true of anytrader. Finding good longs requires a different thought process to \ufb01nding\ngood shorts. Furthermore, during any speci\ufb01c time period it is likely that\nthe market has been kinder to one direction than the other. In equity invest-ing there are periods where value dominates growth. This will also apply to\nvolatility trading where, for periods of time, the longs will outperform the\nshorts. We shouldn\u2019t overreact to this and chase the hot strategy, but it is\ngood to know. Sometimes we just have to stick to our approach and wait\nfor the market to swing back in our favor. As long as you can \ufb01nd value,either way can work. But they are unlikely to work equally well for any\nindividual.\nMany traders also use a fundamental view as a \ufb01nal consideration be-\nfore taking a trade, maybe deciding that in the current market environmentselling volatility in a mortgage lender is a bad idea, for example. On the\none hand it seems obvious that the judgment of an experienced marketparticipant must add value in this regard. On the other hand, how much\ndoes a random option trader know about the dynamics of any particular\nindustry beyond what he reads in the papers? Tracking the results of thesejudgment calls will settle the argument\u2014not just vaguely recalling the big\nwinners and losers, but looking at complete results for all of the trades that\nwere done and also those that were rejected. Seems like too much work?It is a lot of work, but it isn\u2019t too much. It is necessary.\nAnother apparent source of edge that may just be an expensive illusion\nis working into trades by trying to sell the offer and buy the bid. When this\nworks it is obviously a good thing, but how often does it actually work?\nHow often do you not sell the offer and end up chasing ever lower bids?There is no reason why you cannot quantify this. And since you can, you\nshould.\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n134 VOLATILITY TRADING\nAfter each expiration cycle a similar analysis should be done, but this\ntime we view each trade as a single completed event. Here we are not\nfocused on the trades\u2019 temporal evolution, just on its results. At this point\ntrades should be segmented into long volatility and short volatility trades.\nEach sector should also be broken out. It is quite possible that the ap-\nproach we have designed, which uses historical data analysis to evaluateprospective trades, is more suitable to some sectors than to others. Some-times this is obvious. The trading of small biotechnology companies should\nclearly be a case where the past is only very tangentially related to the\nfuture. But sometimes there may be a factor missing in the analysis thatisn\u2019t obvious. For example, I have never had much success trading retail\nstocks. I don\u2019t know what I am missing, but at this point I need to acknowl-\nedge that my results are signi\ufb01cantly different from those in other sectorsand that this is unlikely to be due to luck. If we had not broken down trade\nresults by sector we would never have discovered this fact.\nThese numbers should give us a good place to start in setting our goals.\nThe initial numbers to look at are the daily pro\ufb01t in dollar amounts as a re-turn on the haircut that our clearing \ufb01rm requires us to put up in collateral\nto hold the position. The fact that we have an average 1 percent return eachday on the used haircut makes this trade seem at least super\ufb01cially attrac-\ntive. But a trade\u2019s effectiveness cannot be judged purely on its returns. Risk\nis also a consideration. Low-risk trades can always be more heavily lever-\naged to increase return.\nAs a slight aside, do not consider the required haircut to be a measure\nof risk. This is best thought of as purely a \ufb01nancing requirement. If a traderis trading only a few products or only products with very similar price and\nvolatility characteristics, he may be able to closely associate haircut andrisk, but this is generally not the case. For example, it is a common practice\nin the equity world to calculate the haircut for a short option position based\non a 15 percent move in the underlying. This will dramatically overstate therisk of a short volatility position in IBM, which trades at an implied volatil-\nity in the teens, and it will dramatically understate the risk associated with\na short volatility position in a biotechnology company that trades at an im-plied volatility of over 100. If you think of haircut as a risk measure, please\nstop now. It might or might not be a valid way for a clearing \ufb01rm to manage\nits business, but it is a terrible way for an option trader to manage his.\nRISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nAll measures of risk have weaknesses. Here we look at several of the stan-\ndard measures. Generally options traders are benchmarked to the return\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\nTrade Evaluation 135\non cash, so we will ignore measures that compare our performance to other\nbenchmarks.\nThe Sharpe Ratio\nThis is the ratio of the annualized return over the risk-free rate divided by\nthe volatility (Sharpe 1966).\nSR=\u00b5\u2212r\n\u03c3(7.1)\nIf returns are normally distributed, then this has a relationship to\nthe probability of making a return greater than the risk-free rate. Of\ncourse returns are practically never normal. The Sharpe ratio has manywell-documented weaknesses. In fact, its weaknesses are so well doc-\numented and often referred to, that its considerable strengths are now\noften overlooked. The fact that it isn\u2019t perfect does not mean it is notuseful.\nStrengths\nrIt is simple, both to calculate and to understand.rIt is an intuitively good thing to calculate. It is a ratio of return to risk,\nand while volatility doesn\u2019t capture all elements of risk it at least cap-\ntures some.rIt is leverage independent so we can compare strategies and traders\noperating in different spaces.rIt is something of an industry standard. The Sharpe ratio is almost to\nrisk what BSM is to option pricing: Practitioners are aware that it is\nimperfect, but it gives a de\ufb01ned framework to risk.\nWeaknesses\nrWhat is the risk-free rate? The calculation assumes that we can investand borrow at this rate. Typically we use the midmarket value from our\nclearing \ufb01rm. But we really need to bear in mind why we are calculatingthe ratio when we choose the rate. A strategy that returns 6 percent is\nviable if we can borrow at 5 percent to gain the bene\ufb01ts of leverage,\nbut is no use if our borrowing rate is 6 percent.\nrThe Sharpe ratio is based on historical numbers. This raises a number\nof problems. The \ufb01rst is a form of the peso problem. Just because a\nstrategy hasn\u2019t had any losses in the past doesn\u2019t mean that it has norisk. Many super\ufb01cially enticing option strategies are of this form. It is\nquite easy to obtain a high Sharpe ratio (double digits) by selling far\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n136 VOLATILITY TRADING\nout-of-the-money options. Most days this will make a small amount of\nmoney but eventually it will suffer a large loss. Note that while this\nstrategy may be pro\ufb01table, the objection is still valid. Any risk mea-\nsure based on historical returns will show only what has happened,\nnot what could happen. Having good statistics doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t\nneed to carefully consider the process generating the returns. This isvery important. Just looking at historical numbers does not give anindication of good future performance. In fact, past returns of hedge\nfunds seem to have almost no predictive power for their future returns\n(Capocci 2007).\nrWe stated early in Chapter 2 that measuring historical returns gives a\nvery noisy result. We also spent considerable time looking at the sam-\npling error in volatility estimates. We can reasonably conclude thatsampling errors are a problem with the Sharpe ratio. This has been\nstudied by Lo (2002), who showed that asymptotically the measured\nSharpe ratio is normally distributed around the true Sharpe ratio witha variance of\nV=1\n\u221a\nT/parenleftbigg\n1+1\n2SR2/parenrightbigg\n(7.2)\nSo the standard deviation of the Sharpe ratio is the same order of mag-nitude as the measured result. As an example, we simulated a GBM\nprocess with an annualized drift of 0.2 and an annualized volatility\nof 0.3, 10,000 times. We measured the Sharpe ratio of the realized re-turns over 100 days. The average measured Sharpe ratio was 0.5. This\nwas slightly lower than the theoretical value of 0.66 that was expected\nas the Sharpe ratio does have a measurement bias in small samplesofS/2T(Christie 2005). But the real problem was the standard devi-\nation of 1.61, which agrees with Lo\u2019s result. This makes the Sharperatio a particularly blunt tool for distinguishing between traders orstrategies.\nrWhat should we take the account size to be when calculating the re-turns and volatilities? If we are running a stand-alone fund, the answeris obvious: the value of assets under management. But most option\ntraders are not operating under this arrangement. Arguments can be\nmade for using return on utilized haircut, which is a measure of returnon capital committed; or return on maximum allowed haircut, which\nis return on the capital the managers have allocated to the trade. If\nthis money is not entirely committed by the trader, that re\ufb02ects lack ofopportunity and indicates breadth limitations of the strategy.

There isn\u2019t much point in a trader reveling in the return on\ncommitted capital if he can only \ufb01nd one or two trades a year. Some\ntraders in banks may not even have access to haircut amounts. In this\ncase they could use absolute dollar returns instead of percentage orlogarithmic returns. This may be necessary when trades are backed\nonly by credit lines rather than cash or equivalents.\nAlternatives to the Sharpe Ratio\nThe general idea is to compute the ratio of a good thing, the return, to\na bad thing: the volatility. But volatility isn\u2019t really bad. The volatility of\nour account caused by large pro\ufb01ts is good. It is just losses that are bad.\nBut Sharpe treats upside and downside volatility equally. It is actually verysimple to construct some P/L paths that demonstrate this weakness of the\nSharpe ratio. We can easily show two equity curves that the Sharpe ratio\nranks in one order, whereas we can argue by qualitative judgment that theSharpe ratio ranking was wrong. We present an example of this situation\nin Figure 7.4. The upper equity curve has a Sharpe ratio of 4.7 while the\nlower has a Sharpe ratio of 7.4. But clearly in some sense the upper curveis better.\nAnother way to visualize this issue is to state that the two return distri-\nbutions in Figure 7.5 have the same mean and standard deviation, but wewould not expect investors to be indifferent to their risk-reward character-\nistics.\nWe can change the speci\ufb01cs of the Sharpe ratio but keep the gen-\neral idea by replacing the denominator with another measure of risk.\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n138 VOLATILITY TRADING\n00.020.040.060.080.10.12\n\u221220 \u221210 0 1 02 03 04 0\nReturn\nFIGURE 7.5 Two Very Di\ufb00erent PDFs with Identical Means and Variances\nA commonly used adjustment of this type is to use downside deviation\ninstead of standard deviation. This leads to the Sortino ratio (Sortino and\nPrice 1994):\nSortino =\u00b5\u2212r\n\u03c3d(7.3)\nwhere \u03c3dis the downside deviation, the standard deviation of all losses.\nAnother interesting risk measure is the Calmar ratio, de\ufb01ned as the\nexcess return divided by the maximum drawdown. A Calmar ratio of1.0 is considered good. This gives us a useful rule of thumb: If you are\nlooking for xpercent return, you need to be prepared for an xpercent\ndrawdown.\nCalmar =\u00b5\u2212r\ndrawdown(7.4)\nThe Sterling ratio is a gains-to-losses measure very much related to the\nCalmar ratio. It is de\ufb01ned as the ratio between the excess return and the\naverage maximum drawdown per year over the past three years minus (an\narbitrary) 10 percent. Sometimes the average of the \ufb01ve largest drawdowns\nis used. The averaging procedure makes the Sterling ratio less dependenton outliers than the Calmar ratio. Each of these alternatives is even more\nprone to errors associated with small samples and the peso problem (as\nwe use less data). Just as we earlier concluded that we would need touse several volatility estimators, we will need to use several performance\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\nTrade Evaluation 139\nmeasures. There is no magic statistic that perfectly captures the quality of\nour performance.\nThese risk measures attempt to address the fact that variance really\ndoesn\u2019t behave as we would like our risk to. But we now have increasedsampling errors. Another way to approach the issue is to base the risk term\n(the denominator) on more than just the second moment of the return\ndistribution. We could use the entire distribution. The \ufb01rst two momentssimply do not capture all the behavior we are interested in. This is the\npremise behind the omega risk measure (Keating and Shadwick 2002),\nwhich is de\ufb01ned as\n/Omega1(r)=b/integraltext\nr(1\u2212F(x))dx\nr/integraltext\naF(x)dx(7.5)\nwhere\n(a,b) is the interval of returnsF is the cumulative distribution of returns\nr is the threshold return level\nSo this is the average value of returns above the threshold, compared\nto the average value of returns below the threshold. The higher the omega,\nthe higher the desirability of the strategy.\nKazemi et al. (2003) show that this can also be expressed as\n/Omega1(r)=C(r)\nP(r)(7.6)\nwhere Cis a call on the strategy and Pis a put on the strategy, each struck\nat the threshold and for one period (this form might make it easier for op-\ntion traders to build intuition). But note that this is the value of the call\nunder the true return distribution, not the risk-neutral distribution and cer-\ntainly not the lognormal distribution. So this formulation is probably moreuseful conceptually rather than computationally.\nOmega might be theoretically nice but, as option traders are well\naware, extrapolating extreme events into the future isn\u2019t particularly wise,and the presence or absence of some extremes can signi\ufb01cantly alter\nomega. (This is true for all the risk measures we have discussed, but it\nneeds to be emphasized here that just because omega utilizes the entiredistribution doesn\u2019t mean its measurement is robust.)\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n140 VOLATILITY TRADING\nNote that all of these alternatives are based on historical numbers. This\nis largely unavoidable, but we must always remain cognizant of this fact.\nJust because something horri\ufb01c hasn\u2019t happened in the past is no guarantee\nit won\u2019t happen in the future. These ratios all quantify what the risk/returnbalance has been, and we need to apply judgment before we can conclude\nthat they say anything sensible about the future.\nConclusions\nrThe fact that the strengths and alternatives took about four lines to list,\nwhereas the weaknesses took \ufb01ve pages, just means that the strengths\nare more obvious, not that they are dominated by the weaknesses.rIf you understand the trading process well, the Sharpe ratio can help to\nquantify the results. If you don\u2019t understand the process well enough\nto judge whether the Sharpe ratio\u2019s \ufb02aws are overwhelming, no other\nstatistical risk measure will help, either.rScalability is probably more important than the Sharpe ratio. A Sharpe\nratio of 3 is very good, but if the strategy only has a capacity of a million\ndollars then it can\u2019t really form the basis of a viable business.rTraders respond to incentives. If they are rewarded for having a high\nSharpe ratio they will quickly learn to game it in some way. It is impor-\ntant that the manager or capital provider is aware of the ways that each\nrisk measure can be fooled. This is also a reason why all trading oper-\nations should have risk management that is separate from the tradingoperation. Even where no deception is intended or being deliberately\nattempted, traders can start to game performance measures. It is vital\nto have an independent overview of strategies and risk.\nSETTING GOALS\nNow we have the necessary tools and statistics to estimate some reason-\nable trading goals. This could be done using analytical formulae based on\nthe properties of the normal distribution, but it is usually far more instruc-tive to look at the results of some simulations. Readers can run their own\nusing the spreadsheet \u201ctradinggoals.xls.\u201d In Figure 7.6 we look at what hap-\npens when we simulate the results of a quarter of a year. The expected re-turn is 100 percent on our haircut and we have a Sharpe ratio of 4. One path\nachieved a pro\ufb01t of $ 250,000 (on a haircut of $1 million) while another lost\n$100,000.\nWe can see that even these (very good) numbers can give some very\npoor performance when viewed over such a short period. Even managers\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\nTrade Evaluation 141\n\u2212300,000\u2212200,000\u2212100,0000100,000200,000300,000400,000\n1\n59\n13\n17\n2125293337\n41\n454953\n57\n61\nTime (Days)P/L (Dollars)\nFIGURE 7.6 This Shows the Results of 20 Simulations of the Same Trading\nProcess\nwith a good understanding of statistics can lose patience when a suppos-\nedly good trader, who was presumably given money to trade on the basis of\nhis track record, treads water or even loses money for a quarter. Most willask questions along the lines of, \u201cWhat is going wrong?\u201d or \u201cDoes this just\nnot work any more?\u201d Something could indeed be going on. The markets\nare always changing, and if we don\u2019t strive to improve, we will see perfor-mance decay. But it is also possible that the trader is just unlucky and we\nare simply seeing the effects of variance and a small sample size.\nIn this case, much angst could be saved by setting realistic goals at the\nstart of the year. Here the trader and his manager and capital providerscould come up with something like the following:\nrAfter one quarter we will reevaluate the operation and check that noth-\ning material has changed that could adversely affect the trade. For ex-\nample, a market making operation could obviously be impacted by the\nintroduction of penny quotes in options. This sort of structural changecannot be ignored.\nrPro\ufb01ts of more than $400,000 would indicate that everything is workingwell and we can be reasonably con\ufb01dent that the trader is as good aswe expected. We might even consider allocating more capital to this\nparticular trade.\nrPro\ufb01ts of between $0 and $200,000 should leave us cautiously opti-mistic. We would leave capital allocation at the initial level.\nrLosses of more than $250,000 will be cause to stop trading and reeval-\nuate the operation.\nWe now have de\ufb01nite benchmarks. These can always be reevaluated,\nbut it is vital to have established them before trading starts. Having them\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n142 VOLATILITY TRADING\nestablished prior to trading makes it harder to fall victim to overmanage-\nment, either by you or by your capital providers. Adjusting trade size dras-\ntically based on recent results is suboptimal. Pick an account size and a\nsizing scheme and stick to it.\nThere will always come a time when someone asks if your last period\nof results indicates that something material has changed. Unless it is obvi-ous that something has actually changed, it is very dangerous to speculateabout this. Obviously, every trade result can be ascribed to some effect or\nother. We can attach some narrative to every result. But our testing and pre-\nvious trading results should be considered far stronger evidence than theimmediate past. How many previous times have you had similar results?\nDid they show up in back-testing?\nI recently spoke to a trader who had generated 80 percent winning\ndays (he was scalping commodity future spreads, a very short gamma pro-\ufb01le trade). He was asked by management if he should trade smaller after\ntwo consecutive losing days. Given that 20 percent of his days were losers,two losing days in a row was not uncommon. His manager wasn\u2019t suggest-\ning trading smaller purely because his account was smaller as a result of\nhis losses, as you would if you were following a Kelly sizing methodology.He was suggesting arbitrarily dropping size by 50 percent. Trading smaller\nhere would only indicate that his manager wasn\u2019t really comfortable with\nthe trade at all. This can happen. It is fair that people can change their mind,\nand refusing to do so in cases where the new evidence is compelling is very\nworrisome. But arbitrarily trading smaller is almost never a good idea.\nIf you still like the basic premise of the trade, if the results are consis-\ntent with past results, if the market isn\u2019t obviously and dramatically dif-ferent, and if the capital provider\u2019s overall portfolio hasn\u2019t dramaticallychanged, then you should just keep going. Otherwise this discretionary\noverriding of the trade sizing will be (by a considerable amount) the largest\nsingle determining factor in a strategy\u2019s pro\ufb01tability. Is it really a good ideato mix a carefully tested methodology that may generate hundreds or thou-\nsands of trades each year with three or four externally generated override\ndecisions?\nAnother reason against trading smaller in this way is that while it re-\nduces the results of the trading, it also proportionally increases the drag ofmany \ufb01xed costs. This can make it impossible to succeed at all. Remem-ber that you should only be doing trades you like. If you aren\u2019t con\ufb01dent\nenough in the basic idea, don\u2019t trade it at all.\nPERSISTENCE OF PERFORMANCE\nAre there any complementary methods we could use to distinguish the skill\nin our performance from luck? By skill we mean repeatable and active\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\nTrade Evaluation 143\nmanagement. The repeatable quali\ufb01cation is important. Golf would cer-\ntainly be regarded as a skillful activity, but hitting one fairway in every\nhundred drives would not be considered a good example of skill.

The repeatable quali\ufb01cation is important. Golf would cer-\ntainly be regarded as a skillful activity, but hitting one fairway in every\nhundred drives would not be considered a good example of skill. We re-\nquire a certain amount of consistency in our results.\nIn fact, when it comes to trading, consistency is far better than return.\nWe have said this several times already. A consistent result can be moresafely leveraged. If the cumulative pro\ufb01ts are smooth enough we can useleverage to get any return we like. While performance measurement over\na given period (by whatever measure we choose) gives a static view of\nperformance, its persistence is more revealing. We are really looking forpersistent, good performance. Sadly, there is no simple way to achieve con-\nsistency other than by trying to do our best on each trade. But we can at\nleast hope to measure consistency. This might be helpful when monitoringour own progress or when deciding to get involved with other traders (or\nany actively managed account).\nSimply comparing performance in successive time periods is unlikely\nto yield any statistically signi\ufb01cant results, although sometimes a funda-mental change in the market will make it obvious that two periods cannot\nbe sensibly compared. For example, it is obvious that the performance of\na market maker will change when the tick size in his product is reduced\nfrom nickels to pennies.\nAt this point it is also worth emphasizing that two aspects of perfor-\nmance persistence exist. The \ufb01rst is relative persistence. That refers to\npersistence of a ranking between winners and losers. The second is abso-\nlute persistence. This refers to persistence of a trader or strategy without\nconsidering any others. These are two different things and one does notnecessarily imply the other.\nRelative Persistence\nThis is the easiest to quantify. It is of practically no use to individual tradersbut it can be very useful to a manager who has to allocate capital and risk\namongst a number of traders. It can be simply (and nonparametrically) es-\ntimated by applying the cross product ratio (CPR) test. Here we split thetime period in two and look at the performances of each trader in each pe-\nriod. Those who perform above the median (based on whatever criterion\nwe might chose) are designated good, G, and those who fall below the me-\ndian are bad, B. So, for example, a trader who performed well in the \ufb01rst\nsubperiod but poorly in the second would be labeled GB. The CPR ratio is\nde\ufb01ned as\nCPR=GC\u00b7BB\nGC\u00b7BG(7.7)\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n144 VOLATILITY TRADING\nTABLE 7.2Trader Performance in the Two\nSubperiods\nGB\nG 12 8\nB 11 9\nIf there is no persistence, each designation will contain 25 percent of\nthe traders and the ratio will be equal to 1. A score greater than 1 indi-\ncates persistence. The signi\ufb01cance of the ratio is tested by calculating the\nzstatistic, where\nz=ln (CPR)/radicalbigg\n1\nGC+1\nBB+1\nGB+1\nBG(7.8)\nConsider the example where we can allocate between 40 different op-\nportunities (traders, strategies, or funds). We split them up into the four\ncategories and get results in Table 7.2.\nHere the CPR is given by (12 \u00d79)/(11 \u00d78)=1.23. This is greater than\n1, but the sample size is small and it is quite possible that the true popu-lation ratio is 1. The zscore from equation (7.8) is 0.32. To be signi\ufb01cant\nat the 5 percent level we require a score of over 1.96. So this isn\u2019t evenclose to being signi\ufb01cant. There are other tests for relative persistence (forexample chi-square, Spearman correlation, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test),\nbut we won\u2019t look at these because this type of persistence isn\u2019t really an\noverwhelming concern for most traders. What they really want to see isabsolute persistence.\nAbsolute Persistence\nWe can calculate a measure of pure persistence in a trader\u2019s returns by cal-\nculating the Hurst exponent. A Hurst exponent greater than 0.5 indicates\npersistence. An exponent less than 0.5 is indicative of antipersistence ormean reversion. The Hurst exponent applies to data sets that are statisti-\ncally self-similar. This means that the statistical properties for the data set\nare constant (this is an assumption that we make in most of these analy-ses). The Hurst exponent is intimately related to the fractal dimension of a\ndata set and chaos theory, which is well beyond the scope of this book. The\ninterested reader should refer to Peters 1996 and the references therein.\nFirst we need to understand rescaled range analysis (often called\nR/S analysis). We know that when we \ufb02ip an unbiased coin, the expected\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\nTrade Evaluation 145\ndifference between the number of heads and tails in Nattempts grows as\nN0.5. This is a characteristic of Brownian motions. In general,\nR\u2248cNh(7.9)\nwhere\nRis the range\ncis a constant\nhis the scaling exponent; h=0.5 in the coin-tossing example.\nHurst (1951) generalized this concept from the special case where\nh=0.5. We start with a time series, xt, and construct the series of devi-\nations\nDt,N=t/summationdisplay\nk=1(xk\u2212MN) (7.10)\nwhere\nDt,Nis the cumulative deviation over N periods\nMNis the average of xtover Nperiods\nThe range is then de\ufb01ned as the difference between the maximum and\nminimum value calculated in equation (7.10).\nR=max( Dt,N)\u2212min( Dt,N) (7.11)\nWe now normalize the range by dividing by the standard deviation of\nthe original observations. This is the rescaled range, R/S. The Hurst expo-\nnent, h, is de\ufb01ned by\nR/S=(aN)h(7.12)\nTaking logarithms gives us an equation that can easily be estimated by\nlinear regression.\nln(R/S)=hln(N)+ln(a) (7.13)\nThis requires a fairly large amount of data to estimate accurately. Hurst\nalso gave a simple approximation, which estimates hfrom a single value.\nh=ln(R/S)\nln/parenleftbiggN\n2/parenrightbigg (7.14)\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n146 VOLATILITY TRADING\nThis assumes that the constant ain equation (7.13) is equal to 0.5. This\napproximation tends to overstate hwhen it is greater than 0.7 and under-\nstate hwhen it is less than 0.4. However, for short data series where regres-\nsion results will be unreliable, it gives a reasonable estimate.\nWhen applying rescaled range analysis to trading results, the time se-\nries under consideration should be the logarithmic return series.\nWithout doubt, the toughest situation to evaluate and handle is where\na long-term winning trade starts to degrade in performance. Can we just\nput this down to luck? That could be possible, but we need to be as careful\nhere, when separating randomness from signal, as we were when we wereevaluating successful trades. After a certain number of trades, only a few\npossibilities remain:\nrThe source of edge has disappeared. Sometimes this can be obvious,\nsuch as when the tick size in QQQQ options was reduced from a nickelto a penny. This was clearly an issue market makers needed to adapt to.\nBut sometimes the cause of the degradation is more subtle. I am good\nfriends with a very successful baseball gambler who in 2003 had a re-turn of over 400 percent with a Sharpe ratio of 4. The bets were based\non extensive sabermetric analysis and computer simulations. By 2007\nhis return had dwindled to nothing. He had learned more about base-ball, but the market had learned faster (he now trades equity options).\nrTheir ability to execute the trade has declined. This could be due tochanging technology (which could probably go into the preceding cat-egory if technological execution was actually the original source of\nedge) or to the effects of increasing age or lack of desire.\nrThe counterparties of their trades have changed. There is a very big\ndifference to taking the other side of retail \ufb02ow and trading with other\nprofessionals.\nOnce you have identi\ufb01ed a change in performance, you need to com-\npare your current methodology to your behavior when you were winning.\nWhat has changed? Sometimes you will \ufb01nd that you are now taking short-\ncuts due to boredom or overfamiliarity. If you can\u2019t \ufb01nd any differences,\nget a second opinion.\nChanges, in ourselves or in the markets, can occur so gradually that\nwe are unaware of them. Sometimes it pays to ask, \u201cIf I was starting today,would I choose this product to trade? Why?\u201d (Flexibility when it comesto choosing products is a great advantage. This option is generally not\navailable to institutional traders, but even if the question is hypothetical,\nit can be a useful exercise to identify possible changes that need to beadapted to). A good rule to remember is that it is making money that\ncounts, not trading the most complex or glamorous products. This isn\u2019t like\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\nTrade Evaluation 147\nprofessional sports.

There are no minor leagues.\nSUMMARY\nRecord keeping isn\u2019t very exciting or glamorous, but it is exceptionally im-\nportant. It is impossible to improve if you don\u2019t know exactly how good you\nare and what areas need most improvement. Setting up a results-tracking\nand performance-measurement methodology is probably the single bestthing that a trader could do to improve.\nrKeep track of the daily results of all trades.rAll trades should have preestablished goals so that terms like success\nandfailure are de\ufb01ned in advance.rAll instances where a trading signal is overridden, either by a trader orby a manager, should be noted so that we know how successful such\ncalls are.\nrAll risk measures have weaknesses. As with our use of different volatil-ity estimators, learn to use a variety of measures and become comfort-\nable with the different pictures they provide.\nrRemain aware that even a good strategy can go through bad periods.\nDon\u2019t give up on the basis of a poor performance over a small sample\nsize unless something has de\ufb01nitely changed in the market.rConsistency of performance is more important than the actual level of\nperformance.\nc07 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 20:15 Char Count=\n148\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\nCHAPTER 8\nPsychology\nThe baseball writer, guru, and iconoclast Bill James once said, \u201cTwen-\ntieth century man uses psychology exactly like his ancestors used\nwitchcraft; anything you don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s psychology.\u201d This ap-\nplies to the world of trading, where psychology is frequently given as a rea-\nson for market moves, traders\u2019 reactions, and position management issues.\nMore nonsense is written about the bene\ufb01ts of \u201ctrading psychology\u201d thanany other aspect of the trading business. Many traders think that they are\nbeing held back by their emotional issues\u2014but it is much more likely that\ntheir anxiety and tension are caused by their poor trading. Losing money isunpleasant. This is probably the cause of the psychological distress, rather\nthan a symptom of it.\nBluntly put, having great psychological control is totally irrelevant un-\nless you have an edge and unless you have a money management system\nto capture it. There certainly are traders who are held back by their psy-chological issues, but there are many more who really have no edge to\nbegin with or any sensible ideas how to exploit the edge they might have. A\nbaseball analogy might be apt: If Daryl Strawberry had the help of a skilledsports psychologist, he may have been the best player ever to have lived.\nBut if a random person had access to a sports psychologist, it would be a\ngood bet that he still couldn\u2019t get to rookie ball. Without knowledge andskill, psychology of this type is useless.\nThis chapter is not about self-help and af\ufb01rmation. (Anyone who is\nstill convinced that they are the rare case where psychological issues aretruly their limiting factor should consult the books by Brett Steenbarger.\nThey are rare examples of sense in the genre, and even he spends a lot\n149\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\n150 VOLATILITY TRADING\nof time examining details of the trading process rather than psychological\ncrutches.) Rather, we look here at how behavioral psychology can create\nmarket conditions we can take advantage of, and how it can lead us astray.\nThis is important, as psychological biases are probably the drivers behindmost sources of edge available to a volatility trader.\nAs alluded to by Bill James, it is very tempting to ascribe any poorly\nunderstood market phenomenon to psychology. Before you do this, makesure it really is about psychology. You should know exactly what psycho-\nlogical phenomenon you are dealing with. Saying \u201cImplied volatility go-\ning bid before earnings announcements is an example of overcon\ufb01denceand representativeness biases\u201d is very different in its testability to \u201cIt is all\nabout fear and greed.\u201d\n(A respected colleague implied that this chapter is different from the\nothers. His point was that while I have mathematical training I am an ama-teur in psychology, with no formal training. This may be important to note\nas some sort of disclaimer, but I\u2019m still going to give my opinions. I maynot be a psychologist but I am a trader and a pragmatist. I would rather\nshare my views and opinions on what is useful than feel constrained by\nlack of formal education in this area. After all, we must take knowledgefrom where we can, and I have found the study of behavioral \ufb01nance use-\nful in looking for trading opportunities.

Note that this view can be seen as the boundary between thinkinglike a trader and thinking like a \ufb01nance theorist. Some of the latter have\nbeen known to protest that \u201cthere is no such thing as behavioral \ufb01nance.\u201d\nTraders tend not to argue that point. They just look for opportunities.)\nOver 50 different behavioral biases, or systematic errors of judgment,\nhave been identi\ufb01ed (for an excellent repository of research and papers,go to www.behavioural\ufb01nance.net). Currently no generally accepted the-ory of classi\ufb01cation exists, and there is considerable overlap between the\nbiases. But there is a general agreement that biases are either cognitive or\nemotional.\nThis distinction is important. Cognitive biases arise from faulty rea-\nsoning so can often be addressed through education and better informa-tion. We can seek to moderate their effects on our trading. Emotionalbiases arise through intuition rather than conscious thought. These are\nmore dif\ufb01cult to cope with, but even if we \ufb01nd them impossible to com-\npletely eradicate in our own trading, they can still be used to spot pro\ufb01table\nopportunities if we can recognize their effects in others.\nIt is also important to remember that all people possess these biases.\nIt is tempting to think that these problems only af\ufb02ict others\u2014that theyhappen to \u201cthem,\u201d not to \u201cus.\u201d But we all suffer from these biases, although\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\nPsychology 151\nobviously some are more inclined to certain defects in thinking than others.\nThis is a very good reason to trade with a partner. It is much easier to point\nout the faults in others than to recognize them in ourselves.\nIf you decide to trade with a partner (and I strongly recommend it), the\nactual selection becomes crucial. A good trading partner needs the follow-ing qualities.\nrAbility to trade. Two heads are not always better than one. Before hecan help at all, a trading partner needs to be a competent trader.\nrConstructively critical. Trading is always evolving. We need to be\naround people who are always trying to improve and to help othersimprove. Acceptance of the status quo won\u2019t help.\nrTrustworthy and relatively emotionally stable.rPersonable. You will be spending a lot of time around this person.You needn\u2019t necessarily be great friends, but there must be a certain\namount of tolerance and mutual respect.\nPsychology isn\u2019t the only thing that drives a market, but there are ef-\nfects in the market that occur from time to time that just seem to be persis-tent. Back-testing will show these to be pro\ufb01table. However, unless we can\nunderstand the source of the mispricing to some degree (be it an arbitrage\nor a psychological reason), we should avoid the trade. Without understand-\ning the cause, how can we know when the trade will cease to work? More\nthan knowing how things work in practice, we must know how they workin theory in order to use the knowledge to our advantage.\nIn the rest of this chapter we examine 10 major thinking errors, state\nwhether they are cognitive or emotional in origin, give examples of howthey might arise in trading situations, and offer some advice on how to\npossibly avoid them in our own trading and exploit their effects on the\ntrading of others.\nSELF-ATTRIBUTION BIAS\nThis \ufb01rst thinking error is a cognitive bias that leads individuals to ascribe\ntheir successes to their skill or hard work and to blame their failures on\noutside in\ufb02uences or bad luck. Actually, a certain degree of self-attributionbias is probably necessary to be successful in any entrepreneurial en-\ndeavor, but if it is not tempered with knowledge of correct trading prob-\nabilities it can be a recipe for disaster. While we all know that some traderscan be braggarts and cocky know-it-alls, the reader of this book, being the\nthoughtful type who puts in a sincere effort to educate himself, probably\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\n152 VOLATILITY TRADING\nthinks he is unusually self-aware and immune to this bias. This is a typical\nexample of the self-attribution bias! Indeed, research has shown that it is\nmuch easier to recognize this bias in others than in oneself.\nAs an example, a number of studies (Bakshi and Kapadia 2003; Coval\nand Shumway 2001; Bondarenko 2003), as well as the careers of some goodtraders, have shown the long-term consistent pro\ufb01tability of selling out-of-\nthe-money index puts. The combination of the implied volatility premiumand the general long-term upward drift of the equity markets (Dimson et al.\n2002) give this trade two sources of edge. There is little doubt that when\ndone cautiously and in an appropriate size this is a sensible trade. How-ever, this can be an extremely risky game to play. A large number of mar-\nket makers have worked this angle, selling 20 to 30 delta puts and hedging\ntheir overall exposure by buying at-the-money or upside options. There isa consistency in their stories: They carefully and skillfully select the ap-\npropriate strike to sell and use their execution skills to sell at the offer.\nThey may also claim to have a quantitative skew valuation model of greatpower. Finally, skillful and astute hedging prowess is also mentioned. But\nwhen they blow up (and, to be fair, not all have), there is a variant of a bad\nluck story: Their clearing house panicked, their technology failed, or theirbroker made a mistake. In reality they were just playing a game with slight\npositive expectation and extreme downside risk. The rest is just a case of\nself-attribution bias.\nSelf-attribution bias is dangerous for two main reasons. First, if we are\nunable to perceive errors as errors, we cannot learn from them. Second,crediting lucky outcomes to our skill can lead to subsequent overcon\ufb01-\ndence. This leads to overtrading and overly aggressive position sizing. An\nexample is that as we research the fundamentals of a company, it is easyto become more convinced of the rightness of our position (refer to the\ndiscussion of the con\ufb01rmation bias later in this chapter). This can lead to a\nlumpy, undiversi\ufb01ed portfolio.\nWe must remember that winning trades are typically dependent on a\nlarge number of factors, with luck being the largest component of any indi-vidual trade. Even after accounting for luck, there will be a large number ofother factors that were never even considered in our pretrade analysis. Try\nto be as objective as possible and engage in as much post-trade analysis as\npossible. Try also to remember that good trades may not be the same aswinning trades.\nOVERCONFIDENCE\nOvercon\ufb01dence is a cognitive bias that manifests as unreasonable belief in\none\u2019s abilities. Ironically, many beginning traders actively try to cultivate\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\nPsychology 153\nexcess con\ufb01dence, believing it is a lack of con\ufb01dence that is holding them\nback. Dr. Brett Steenbarger (www.brettsteenbarger.com) writes amusingly\nof the attitude as \u201cemotional socialism.\u201d This is the idea that somehow we\njust deserve to be con\ufb01dent, rather than developing skill and then learningto be con\ufb01dent in that skill. The mistake that many people make is to study\nthe biggest achievers, hear how supremely con\ufb01dent they are about their\nchances of winning, and confuse cause and effect. When Roger Federerwins a tennis match, for example, he doesn\u2019t win because he thinks that\nhe will. He thinks that he will win because he has done everything he can\nto prepare for it and he is the best tennis player. His con\ufb01dence is entirelyjusti\ufb01ed by his ability.\nNot only is lack of con\ufb01dence not a trader\u2019s biggest problem, but many\ntraders suffer from an excess of con\ufb01dence. This is sometimes betrayed bythe way they refer to their risk management procedures: \u201cWell sure, if the\nDAX drops 20 percent I\u2019ll blow up, but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll see that coming.\u201d\nMany studies (Cosmides and Tooby 1996; Elstein 1999) have shown\nthat people are very bad intuitive statisticians and are not well equipped forestimating probabilities; events that are far from certain are projected to\noccur with a probability of close to 100 percent. As an example, in January2007, AtherGenics (AGIX) was trading around $11. The company had an-\nnounced that the results of phase three trials for the drug AGI-1067 would\nbe reported by the end of the \ufb01rst quarter. This was a binary event for the\ncompany. Good news would drive the stock much higher. Some analysts\nwere projecting this to be a $50 stock.\nGiven this enormous upside potential, the $11 stock price must be say-\ning that the market saw a signi\ufb01cant chance of failure (taking the $11 stockprice to be a probability weighted average of a very high price and a some-what lower price), but bullish chatter was so prevalent that the $45 call in\nApril was trading for $1.15. This was a case of certainty overcon\ufb01dence,\nwhere some traders were far too con\ufb01dent of their projected outcome.Having decided that the company was a good bet, they seemingly ignored\nthe possibility of being wrong.\nA related phenomenon is prediction overcon\ufb01dence, where people as-\nsign far too narrow a range of possibilities to the outcome of an event.Looking again at the AtherGenics example, the range of analyst opinion for\nthe upside value of the stock was between $19 and $50. In the case thatthe stock did get to $50, the purchaser of the $45 calls would have maxi-\nmized his return. (The elasticity of an option is such that the best return\non capital results from buying the option that \ufb01nishes in-the-money by the\nsmallest amount. We want to be as close to being wrong as possible.) How-\never, not only did this trader have to be right, he had to be almost exactlyright. Buying the 12.5 calls (available at the time for 4.5) would have given\na far broader range of pro\ufb01tability.\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\n154 VOLATILITY TRADING\nOn March 19, AtherGenics announced that phase three trials didn\u2019t\nmeet their primary end point. The stock dropped 60 percent. All of the\nheavily traded upside calls expired worthless.\n(Obviously, the reality behind this example would have been far more\ncomplicated, possibly even to the extent of this discussion being a strawman. It is very unlikely that the trader in question had a position consisting\nof only the April 45 calls, and it is sometimes possible that a trade thatlooks foolish in isolation can be perfectly acceptable when incorporated\ninto a portfolio.)\nFurther examples of underestimation of uncertainty that are speci\ufb01-\ncally related to volatility prediction are given by Glaser et al. (2004) andHilton (2001).\nWill Rogers said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t what we don\u2019t know that gives us trou-\nble; it\u2019s what we know that ain\u2019t so.\u201d Overcon\ufb01dence wouldn\u2019t be a prob-lem if what we believed was true actually was true. Sadly, many studies\nhave shown that we will consistently overrate our abilities, particularly\nin areas that are completely outside our circle of competence. It seems\nthat if we have studied an area for long enough, our knowledge becomes\nmore nuanced as we realize that there is still much we don\u2019t know. This\ndoesn\u2019t seem to apply to \ufb01elds that we have only a cursory familiarity\nwith.\nTrading and \ufb01nance is an area in which it is very dif\ufb01cult to really be-\ncome expert, as there are so many (changing) variables to consider. But itis also a \ufb01eld where con\ufb01dence is seen as a great virtue. A study tested pro-fessional \ufb01nancial analysts and money managers (Russo and Shoemaker\n1992). They were asked 10 questions. Each asked for a best estimate and\nhigh and low estimates within which they were 90 percent sure the true an-swer lay. The questions were chosen so that the participants were unlikely\nto know the true answers, such as \u201ctotal area of Lake Michigan in square\nmiles.\u201d On average, the analysts chose con\ufb01dence intervals wide enoughto include the correct answer only 64 percent of the time. The money\nmanagers were worse. They had ranges wide enough only 50 percent of\nthe time.\nOvercon\ufb01dence is one of the worst biases a trader can have. This is\nbecause it directly leads to poorly diversi\ufb01ed portfolios (both of ideas andpositions), overtrading, and inadequately considering the risks associated\nwith extreme moves. These are all sure losers in the long run. It is crucial\nto remember that the most important thing is to stay in the game. Once wehave an edge, if we can play long enough, the law of large numbers will\neventually make us rich. Never do anything that can jeopardize your future\ntrading.\nYou should also know that the less skilled someone is, the more over-\ncon\ufb01dent they tend to be.

But the \ufb01rst piece of evidence that comes to mind will\ninvariably be a dramatic event that isn\u2019t at all typical. And the human mindnaturally judges the frequency of a type of event by the ease with which\ninstances of that event can be recalled. It is a cognitive de\ufb01ciency.\nAs an example, successful traders are generally surrounded by other\nsuccessful traders, either on the exchange \ufb02oor, in their of\ufb01ce, or just so-\ncially. This can lead them to vastly overestimate the ease of becoming asuccessful trader. After all, most of the traders they know are successful.\nThis can directly grow into a feeling of frustration at their own supposed\nlack of success, which is really an illusion caused by the availability heuris-tic. They simply do not see the enormous majority of traders who either\nlose their bankrolls entirely or else just scrape by until they decide to quit\nthe business.\nTrading involves many levels of strategic thinking, and the right way\nto make a decision is often unclear. However, in practice we often thinkthe correct decision is absolutely obvious. Often in these cases we willbe absolutely wrong. If a trader does not have a rational decision-making\nprocess, he may rely on the availability heuristic (rule of thumb).\nIt is tempting to employ the availability heuristic as a \ufb01rst resort. Such\ntraders estimate the likelihood of events (like a takeover or bankruptcy) onthe basis of how easy those events are to imagine. While calculating cor-\nrect probabilities can be easy for those who know the appropriate rules ofthumb and historical trends, traders who have not learned the valid short-\ncuts will naturally use the invalid ones.\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\n156 VOLATILITY TRADING\nTABLE 8.1The Returns of Google Stock on the Day after\nthe Earnings Announcement\nDate Return (%)\n10/21/2004 15.40\n2/1/2005 7.40\n4/21/2005 5.70\n7/21/2005 \u22123.70\n10/20/2005 12.10\n1/31/2006 \u22127.10\n4/20/2006 6.50\n7/20/2006 \u22122.20\n10/19/2006 9.6\nA practical volatility trading example is when deciding whether to sell\na straddle over an earnings announcement or a big economic release. Our\nmind will tend to recall the large move at the expense of the more represen-\ntative moves. Before its \ufb01rst earnings release of 2007, the Google February\nand March straddles were implying a jump of about 16 percent. Googlewas known to be a jittery stock that could move on earnings, but looking\nat the previous nine earnings-related moves (the move from the close be-\nfore earnings results were announced to the close afterward), we saw themoves summarized in Table 8.1.\nThe average magnitude of the moves was 7.7 percent with a maximum\nof 15.4 percent. The straddle price also appeared to be heavily biased by themost recent 9.6 percent jump, which also happened to be the third largest.\nWorse yet, this move was being extrapolated to be even more extreme\u2014in\nfact, it was projected to be the biggest move ever. Based on the entire his-tory of earnings-related moves, the straddle was a good sale. The actual\nstock price move over the earnings report was 1.4 percent, so the short\nvolatility position was a winner. (But even if the result of the trade was\na loser, the short volatility trade itself would still have been a good one\nas it was based on a sensible thought process. Don\u2019t confuse good tradeswith winning trades. A good trade is one that was done for a good reason,\nwhatever its outcome turns out to be.)\nSHORT-TERM THINKING\nThe irrational preference for short-term gains at the expense of long-term\nperformance is a cognitive bias and can have signi\ufb01cant effects on op-\ntion trading, as options have exactly the time decay behavior that can lead\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\nPsychology 157\nus into trouble. Nassim Taleb (2004) has written that this is the basis for\nmost traders\u2019 preference for short gamma positions: They prefer the (pos-\nsible illusion of) steady gains to positive gamma positions with greater\noverall positive expectation that lose money steadily before having aspectacular gain.\nIt is possible to take issue with the idea that we can never sensibly\nvalue short volatility trades, but we must agree that this psychological biasis very powerful. It is tough to have a long volatility position lose money\nevery day, even if the trade eventually turns out to be pro\ufb01table.\nLOSS AVERSION\nLoss aversion is an emotional bias, where the extremely competitive nature\nof traders will work against them. In order to consistently win over the long\nterm it is necessary to accept losses, even to the point of seeing them as no\nmore than a cost of doing business.\nLoss aversion was \ufb01rst noticed as a systematic bias by Kahneman and\nTversky (1991). They saw that people dislike losses more than they likegains. This leads to getevenitis : a condition where traders hold on to losing\npositions too long as they hope for them to rebound so they can exit with\na scratch. Once our original reason for a trade no longer holds, there is no\nreason to remain in the position. Yet even after going through a rational\ndecision-making process that tells us we are on the wrong side of a trade,\nwe still irrationally expect (against the laws of probability) the position togo our way just long enough for us to exit at a better level.\nThe cure is to be myopic with respect to risk management. Always ask,\n\u201cDo I like this position right now?\u201d Given all you know about the situation,would you enter the trade at the current levels? How much the trade has\nmade or lost previously is irrelevant to this evaluation. In fact, it is very\nlikely that a lot of your positions will start by losing money. You enter theposition because it has deviated from fair value. It will often continue to\ndeviate further. Once something is mispriced there is no reason it cannot\nbecome even more mispriced. And as we discussed in Chapter 6, you willactually want to do more as the trade loses money. This is not the classic\nview of the problem caused by loss aversion. Ace Greenberg, the former\nchairman of Bear Stearns, expressed it this way: \u201cThe de\ufb01nition of a goodtrader is a guy who takes losses.\u201d This is a classic piece of trading lore.\nThe view we present here isn\u2019t inconsistent, though it may at \ufb01rst ap-\npear so. The difference is in the dynamics of the instrument being traded. Ifan asset price trends, or at least the trader is executing a strategy based on\nhis belief in trends, it makes sense to cut losses as this is consistent with us\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\n158 VOLATILITY TRADING\nbeing wrong. In a trending environment these losses will grow. This isn\u2019t\nthe case in a mean-reverting environment where the rationale for a trade\nbecomes stronger as we lose (small amounts of) money. But in either case\nthe trader must stay focused on the desirability of the trade at the currentlevel\u2014not on the current realized pro\ufb01t or loss.\nThis bias is also related to cognitive dissonance, which can affect our\njudgments in many areas. This is the feeling of uncomfortable tension thatcomes from holding two con\ufb02icting thoughts in the mind at the same time\n(Festinger 1957). In trading this is related to loss aversion. We are some-\ntimes so desperate to avoid taking a loss that we rationalize our bad tradesas being good even though all the available evidence points the other way.\nIn extreme cases the phrase, \u201cIt is different this time\u201d may even still be\nheard.\nCONSERVATISM AND REPRESENTATIVENESS\nMany volatility trading opportunities arise from identifying situationswhere the market is in a state of either overreaction or underreaction. Con-\nservatism is the cognitive bias that leads people to be too slow to update\ntheir beliefs in response to new information. They tend to cling tenaciouslyto their initial view or forecast. Most people \ufb01nd it very hard to move away\nfrom their initially stated position. When movement does occur it is very\nslow. This leads to underreaction of security prices as the new information\nslowly becomes priced in. This slow updating in turn leads to momentum\nin returns.\nThe classic \ufb01nancial examples refer to post\u2013earnings announcement\ndrift (Bernard 1993) and in particular to the case of analysts being slow toupdate their opinions of a stock after new fundamental information hasbeen released (Amir and Ganzach 1998; Helbok and Walker 2004). The\nsame effect is also probably behind the return persistence in industry sec-\ntors (Chan et al. 1996).\nRepresentativeness is the cognitive bias where we make a judgment\nbased on a stereotype. When we encounter a new situation, we tend to tryto judge it based on our previous knowledge and classi\ufb01cation scheme,even if the new event really is inconsistent with our experience. This\nheuristic is often helpful when it is necessary to make an instant decision\nand may have been a useful evolutionary mechanism. However, when clas-sifying something as representative of a familiar situation, it is really vital\nthat it actually berepresentative of the familiar situation! Unfortunately,\nour brain will try to label it that way, whether it is appropriate or not.\nAlso, we tend to remember probabilities that are representative of our\npersonal experience. This in itself is no problem, but we also tend to draw\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\nPsychology 159\nstatistically invalid conclusions as a result. For example, it is tempting to\nput a trade on in small size to see if it is working before committing more\ncapital. This can be very dangerous if we don\u2019t have a complete understand-\ning of the expected distribution of winning and losing days. Let\u2019s say wehave a trade that in back-testing and actual trading has shown that it pro-\nduces 55 percent winning days. Now let\u2019s say that we hit a winning streak of\neight consecutive wins. Should we get excited and trade bigger? Not really.This win/loss distribution will turn up eight-day winning streaks reason-\nably often (see box). However, the representativeness bias can easily lead\nus to believe that things have changed and the trade has now changed forthe better. It is particularly important that a trader get his managers to un-\nderstand this point, to avoid having trading capital reallocated purely due\nto the \ufb02uctuations we should expect because of randomness.\nConsecutive Successes of Independent Events\nIf we run Ntrials, what is the probability of kconsecutive wins, if the\nprobability of a failure is q, and p =1\u2212qis the probability of success?\nThe exact solution can get very messy, but the probability of no run of\nlength jinNtrials is approximately\nq(N)=(1\u2212px)\n(j+1\u2212jx)q\u00d71\nxN+1(8.1)\nwhere\nx=1+q\u00b7pj+(j+1)(q\u00b7pj)2+... (8.2)\nIn the situation discussed in the section on representativeness, p=0.55\nand j=8. If we have a sequence of 100 trading days, N=100. So\nx\u22481+0.45\u00d70.555+9\u00d7(0.45 \u00d70.555)2=1.003896 (8.3)\nwhich gives\nq(n)=0.6936\nSo about 31 percent of the time we can expect to see eight consecutive\nwins.\nThere are two major types of representativeness bias that we need to\nguard against. The \ufb01rst is base rate neglect. This is where we attempt to\nevaluate a situation by contextualizing it into a familiar classi\ufb01cation. It\ncan be tempting to see a $ 10 biotechnology company and think, \u201cHere we\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\n160 VOLATILITY TRADING\ngo again. This looks just like XYZ Corp.\u201d In reality, every situation is suf\ufb01-\nciently different that this will not work. All trades must be strictly evaluated\non their own merits. Note, however, that this can be taken too far. Some\ntraders take this practice to extremes and use it to justify never studyingthe history or statistics of various trading ideas. Things are never exactly\nlike another event, but things are never totally new, either.\nThe second type is sample size neglect. We have seen the biasing ef-\nfects of sample size in Chapter 2 and probably understand it conceptu-ally, but nonetheless, even very mathematically literate individuals can\ndraw faulty conclusions by considering ludicrously small samples. Assum-ing that conclusions about a population can be drawn from a small sam-\nple was facetiously called \u201cthe law of small numbers\u201d by Kahneman and\nTversky (1971). And because of the pathologically nasty distributions weoften deal with when trading options, the necessary sample size to draw\nsensible conclusions can be very large indeed (possibly even in\ufb01nite).\nBoth types of representativeness can lead to overreaction. We sim-\nply read more into the situation than is justi\ufb01ed by the new information.This appears to be in direct con\ufb02ict with the conservatism bias. People\nare fully capable of exhibiting both biases: underreaction and overreaction\n(Poteshman 2001). The interplay between these effects is at the heart of\nmuch trading knowledge (and also much trading nonsense). Overreactionleads to reversals and underreaction leads to trends.\nAn interesting study (Wu and Massey 2004) has shown that the effects\nare possibly just extreme cases of a single error. Humans don\u2019t have a sys-tematic tendency toward either under- or overreaction. They have a ten-\ndency toward misreaction. If new data appears to \ufb01t with some underlying\nmodel, then people will tend to overweight that data and hence they over-\nreact. In essence, they think they understand what is going on.

But if the\nnew data doesn\u2019t seem to con\ufb01rm any previously held model, then the data\nwill be underweighted and underreaction will be the result.\nCONFIRMATION BIAS\nOnce we have formed an opinion of a situation, we react differently to con-\ufb01rming and contradicting evidence. Speci\ufb01cally we emphasize con\ufb01rming\nevidence and downplay contradictory evidence. We seem to systematically\nconvince ourselves that whatever we want to believe is correct and sup-ported by evidence. No doubt most things will be supported by some evi-\ndence, and this will be the evidence we note.\nCon\ufb01rmation bias will often occur in situations where evidence is\ngenuinely mixed and the correct answer isn\u2019t completely obvious. Forexample, it is possible that some of the predictable patterns in volatility\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\nPsychology 161\nhave persisted because the data for implied volatility hasn\u2019t until recently\nbeen widely available enough to rebut widely held but incorrect pieces of\ntrader lore.\nA very interesting experiment was carried out during the U.S. presi-\ndential election campaign of 2004 (Westen et al. 2006). Thirty men wereincluded in the study; half described themselves as Republicans and half\nas Democrats. During an MRI scan, the subjects were asked to assess con-tradictory statements by both George W. Bush and John Kerry. The scans\nshowed that the part of the brain associated with reasoning, the dorso-\nlateral prefrontal cortex, was not involved when assessing the statements.Conversely, the most active regions of the brain were those involved in pro-\ncessing emotions, con\ufb02ict resolution, and making judgments about moral\naccountability. The research clearly showed why, and even how, peoplecan be given exactly the same information but reach different, even oppo-\nsite, conclusions. Dr. Westen summarized beautifully:\nNone of the circuits involved in conscious reasoning were particu-\nlarly engaged. Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cogni-tive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want, and then\nthey get massively reinforced for it, with the elimination of nega-\ntive emotional states and activation of positive ones. . . . Everyonefrom executives and judges to scientists and politicians may reason\nto emotionally biased judgments when they have a vested interest in\nhow to interpret \u201cthe facts.\u201d\n1\nAs with a lot of cognitive biases, intelligent people may actually be\nmore prone to con\ufb01rmation bias. Intelligent people expect to be right. They\nusually are right. They expect to see con\ufb01rming evidence. So any evidence\nis seen in this light. It actually means that after a certain point we are not\ngaining anything from new evidence at all!\nHINDSIGHT BIAS\nOnce an event has occurred, we tend to think that the event was pre-\ndictable. This is hindsight bias. The single realized outcome is far easier\nfor us to grasp than the multitude of possible outcomes that did not oc-cur. This leads us to overestimate the accuracy of our predictions as we\nretroactively \ufb01t them to data. This is also known as the \u201cI knew it all along\u201d\neffect. The effect has been observed in a number of contexts including\n1www.sciencedaily.com, January 31, 2006.\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\n162 VOLATILITY TRADING\npolitics (Blank et al. 2003), medicine (Arkes 1981), criminal trials (Bryant\nand Brockway 1997) and competitions (Louie et al. 2000).\nIn trading, the major danger arising from hindsight is that it leads us\nto trade too big. It is very easy to look at the result of a trade and think,\u201cWe knew that was going to happen,\u201d and decide to trade much bigger next\ntime. It also leads us to unduly fault people after the event. Looking back\nat what happened in the markets, it is easy to see every development asobvious. (People who manage other traders need to be particularly aware\nof this tendency, as it will just seem like you are pointing out the obvious.\nWhen behaving like this it is tough to be perceived as other than a Mondaymorning quarterback.)\nANCHORING AND ADJUSTMENT\nThis is a cognitive bias that causes us to base estimates and decisions onknown anchors, or familiar positions, with a subsequent adjustment rela-\ntive to this starting point (Kahneman and Tversky 1973). We are better atrelative thinking than absolute thinking.\nIf we are asked whether the price of crude oil was greater or less than\n$60 a barrel, we might be equally likely to give either answer. But if wewere then asked what we thought the actual price was, we would probablyguess that it was somewhere close to the $60 level. We have been anchored\nby the earlier question.\nThis can be a particular problem in volatility trading, where we are\nmaking judgments about relative values of implied and future realizedvolatilities. If we are asked, \u201cWould you sell implied volatility at 40 per-\ncent in AAPL?\u201d our brains will anchor on that level. This is a very differentquestion to, \u201cWhat level would you sell in AAPL?\u201d Try to establish your\nbuying and selling levels before you look at the market\u2019s implied volatility\nto avoid this kind of bias. Doing otherwise is more than just peeking at the\nanswers; it will actively change your answers.\nSUMMARY\nBehavioral \ufb01nance is a fascinating subject and, while it has so far failed to\nprovide a convincing alternative to standard \ufb01nance theory, it is very useful\nfor a trader. It helps to give us a checklist of traps to avoid and is a good\nplace to look for new trading ideas.\nrDon\u2019t trade too often.rDon\u2019t trade too big.rDon\u2019t get into trades where you need to be absolutely correct to pro\ufb01t.\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\nPsychology 163\nrRealize that long volatility positions will lose money most days even if\nthey turn out to be eventually pro\ufb01table.rAdmit it when you are wrong.rSeriously consider the bene\ufb01ts of trading with a partner who can pro-vide alternative viewpoints.\nrBe fully aware of your true source of edge.rBe careful to weight new information appropriately, given its contextand sample size.\nrBe aggressive in looking for evidence that contradicts your view orposition.\nrCarefully evaluate each trade on its continuing merits.rTry to formulate buying and selling levels before looking at the impliedvolatility levels.\nrCarefully consider whether the news sources you use really help or\njust get you thinking like everyone else in the market.rContinue to learn about all aspects of trading.\nc08 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:16 Char Count=\n164\nc09 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 11:12 Char Count=\nCHAPTER 9\nLife Cycle of\na Trade\nIn this chapter we examine a single trade in detail. We begin with the\npretrade process of \ufb01nding a prospective trade, measure and forecast\nvolatility, then execute and hedge the options. Most of the actual trading\nconsists of rehedging according to our predetermined plan and constantly\nreevaluating the position so that our exposure is a re\ufb02ection of our current\nthoughts. Finally, we exit the trade and go through the post-trade analysis.\nPRETRADE ANALYSIS\nJune 25, 2007\nApple computer (AAPL) was a darling of the market. Positioned at the con-\n\ufb02uence of the fashion and technology industries, it could seemingly do no\nwrong as its share price increased to over $125 per share. Over the previ-\nous \ufb01ve years it had rallied on a split-adjusted basis from $8.57, an increase\nof 1,358 percent, as compared to a gain of 54 percent for the S&P 500. TheiPod was a cultural phenomenon and the Mac versus PC commercials were\ngenerally adored. The iPhone launch scheduled for June 29 was expected\nto be the catalyst for another explosive burst.\n1Apple was a perfect example\nof the stock that people many expected to rally and rally big. Conversely,\n1An excellent appraisal of the attitudes of the \ufb01rst group of iPhone buyers was pro-\nvided by Charles Golvin of Forrester Research on CNBC\u2019s Morning Call of July 2,\n2007.

Further, we expected volatility to soften\nbefore the holiday, which would make our liquidation easy even if we had\nto lift offers.\nWe bought back our shorts at an average implied volatility of 29.\nDaily P/L $11,783.75\nTotal P/L $18,389.75\nPOST-TRADE ANALYSIS\nIn seven days we made $18,390 on an average haircut of $76,805, thus giv-ing a return on haircut of 23.9 percent (we can neglect the effect of inter-est here as it was only about $100). We lost money on three days, but on\nthe \ufb01rst of these we were incurring costs by actively crossing the bid/ask\nspread in the options, and on the second day we were happy enough tosell more on the offer as the implied volatility went slightly more bid. We\ndon\u2019t really have enough data points to break this particular trade down\nfurther.\nThis trade was unreasonably successful. We made almost exactly what\nwe hoped for and did it in seven days, instead of having to hold the posi-tion until expiration as we had planned. This is vastly preferable and is a\ncompelling reason to look for trades with speci\ufb01cally timed catalysts that\ncould cause implied volatility to move your way. Having to hold a tradeuntil expiration obviously exposes us to more risk.\nOur decision to exit was perfectly timed, as at 9:00\nA.M. EST the stock\nbegan a strong rally to close at 127. This would not have worked out wellfor us. Implied volatility rose to 43 and we would have lost money hedging\nour short gamma. This would be inevitable regardless of our speci\ufb01c hedg-\ning policy, as a daily range of this size would imply a volatility of about 110percent. Being short from 30 would have been a loser.\nHowever, if we held our trade until expiration we would still have made\nmoney. Running the trade as a paper trade until expiration, and hedgingaccording to the strategy we would have used, gave a P/L pro\ufb01le as shown\nin Table 9.2 and Figure 9.7.\nThis is not the perfect trade that we achieved by exiting early, but it\nis a solid winner. As our pretrade analysis indicated, we had enough of amargin for error that the large move on July 5 wasn\u2019t enough to turn the\ntrade into a loser.\nWe do these trades on the premise that implied volatility is incorrect\nover the lifetime of the option. It is average volatility that is important.\nc09 JWBK128-Sinclair April 5, 2008 11:12 Char Count=\n172 VOLATILITY TRADING\nTABLE 9.2 The P/L of the Paper Trade Held until Expiry\nDate P/L Total P/L\n6/25/2007 $(121) $(121)\n6/26/2007 $(4,832) $(4,953)\n6/27/2007 $5,338 $385\n6/28/2007 $7,044 $7,429\n6/29/2007 $(823) $6,606\n7/2/2007 $7,044 $13,650\n7/3/2007 $321 $13,971\n7/5/2007 $(21,766) $(7,795)\n7/6/2007 $5,112 $(2,683)\n7/9/2007 $(584) $(3,267)\n7/10/2007 $2,618 $(649)\n7/11/2007 $3,414 $2,765\n7/12/2007 $2,989 $5,753\n7/13/2007 $(476) $5,277\n7/16/2007 $(9) $5,268\n7/17/2007 $3,045 $8,313\n7/18/2007 $(1,305) $7,008\n7/19/2007 $1,160 $8,168\n7/20/2007 $(1,450) $6,718\nWe can afford to have a few bad days.

You must have a goal; you must \ufb01nd trades with\nedge; you must capture that edge; and you must size each trade in a\nway that is consistent with your goal. Everything else you do must be done\nwithin this framework.\nYour goal must be clearly de\ufb01ned and easily expressed. It must be one\nthing. \u201cI want to make as much money as possible, with minimal risk anda steady income,\u201d is not a goal. It is three goals. You need to focus, at least\ninitially, on one thing. Once you are clearly achieving that one thing youcan then add new goals, but if you do not clearly enunciate a goal you will\nnever achieve anything. And if you cannot explain it in one sentence, you\nare probably not completely clear about what it is. Next, the other parts of\nthe trading strategy can be developed, always thinking about how they \ufb01t\ninto the overall framework provided by the goal.\nTo make money we need an edge. Any successful trading methodology\nmust have a clear statistical edge. If you do not know exactly what youredge is you should not trade. Here we have focused on the careful mea-surement and forecasting of realized volatility, and we aim to trade when\nthis diverges signi\ufb01cantly from that implied by the options market. When-\never this divergence exists you must understand why the options are pricedthat way and why the market is mispricing the situation. Sometimes values\nwill be at historically unprecedented levels and they should be because the\ncurrent fundamental situation for that underlying is also historically un-precedented.\n175\nc10 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:12 Char Count=\n176 VOLATILITY TRADING\nIn addition to the numerical evaluation of a potential trade, you should\nbe able to identify and evaluate the reason that implied volatility is priced\nwhere it is. This is the point where it is necessary to be on top of recent\nnews stories, sector trends, and behavioral psychology.\nMispriced volatility can only be captured with an ef\ufb01cient and effec-\ntive hedging strategy. This transforms the options prices from directionalbets into a volatility trade. Hedging may super\ufb01cially look like tradingthe underlying, but its goal is totally different. We are not trying to make\npro\ufb01table directional trades. We are trying to manage our volatility trade in\nthe cheapest possible way. Hedging makes volatility trading very path de-pendent: It is quite possible to predict volatility correctly and lose money.\nThis dissonance between being correct and making money makes volatility\ntrading an inherently statistical business.\nTrades need to be sized correctly. This means that each trade is evalu-\nated according to its projected return and risk, in the overall context of ourgoals. The same trade will be sized differently by different traders, depend-ing on whether they aim to maximize pro\ufb01ts or to achieve a certain speci\ufb01c\npro\ufb01t goal each year. We don\u2019t know how each trade will play out, but with\nexperience we can become increasingly con\ufb01dent of the statistical likeli-hood of a trade being a winner. A well-thought-out sizing scheme can turn\na string of highly uncertain events (such as individual option trades) into a\nconsistently pro\ufb01table business.\nHowever, in order to do this you must keep comprehensive, accurate\nrecords. You absolutely must know the P/L pro\ufb01le of all your trades. Infact, if you don\u2019t do this, there is really no way you can improve. How\ncan you improve if you don\u2019t even know how well you are doing? Admit-\ntedly, record keeping isn\u2019t much fun, but having money is fun and keepingrecords is essential to get it.\nThis process is necessary but, sadly, doing all of these things is not\nsuf\ufb01cient. When all things are equal, the trader with more knowledge willdo better, but all things are not equal. There are other things that are also\nessential, and while I cannot really quantify their importance, it is entirely\npossible that they are even more important than knowledge. What are thesethings?\nEXECUTION ABILITY\nExecution ability is the skill that enables us to participate in the trades inwhich we want to engage. In pit-traded products this could be related tophysical proximity to important brokers or even just being a nice guy. The\nexecution edge could also come from speed of technology, connections to\nimportant customers, or the considerably less reliable method of reading\nc10 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:12 Char Count=\nConclusion 177\na broker, where a trader learns to guess the incoming order from certain\nphysical clues.\nIn many trading situations, execution ability is the single most impor-\ntant skill to have. Many traders will have the same rough idea of value.Those who are best at getting trades will be the ones who make money.\nThere are some unknowledgeable traders who are especially adept at trade\nexecution, which counteracts many of their other defects.\nCONCENTRATION\nConcentration is important in trading. Some people are just better at payingattention than others.\nConcentration in itself is not enough to turn a nonstudious trader into\na winner, but it could be a reason why someone who knows less thanyou does better than you. Actually, it seems that the more knowledgeable\ntraders tend to be the most defective in concentration.\nPRODUCT SELECTION\nProduct selection is probably the biggest factor in the success of an individ-\nual. Are you prepared to move to Singapore because things are busy there?No? Well someone is. And he will get paid for that willingness. Would you\nrather be a well-known \ufb01gure in a complex product or an unknown in corn\noptions?

Technical knowledge must be learnedsimply because it can be learned. It won\u2019t guarantee success, though, be-\ncause there are other aspects that also need to be present to be successful.\nAlways remain aware that a model is not a strategy, and a strategy is not\na business. Further, be cognizant that a huge part of your success lies in\nchoosing good products to trade. Even the best trader will have a toughtime trading a product with little end-user interest, while many mediocre\ntraders have made money by trading busy products. Remember that the\naim is to make money, not to show what a great trader you are.\nWe also need to pay attention to seemingly mundane things like hav-\ning good execution software, hardware that is reliable, a comfortable of-\ufb01ce, and getting enough sleep. However, knowledge is certainly a source\nof edge. So, all else being equal, the trader with the greater knowledge will\nbe the more successful.\nGood luck.\nc10 JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:12 Char Count=\n178\nAppA JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:13 Char Count=\nAPPENDIX A\nModel-Free\nImplied Variance\nand Volatility\nOur derivation of BSM made certain assumptions about the behavior\nof the underlying. It is also possible, given the options, to calculate\na volatility that makes no such assumptions. This is referred to as\nmodel-free implied volatility and forms the basis for the pricing of variance\nswaps and the calculation of the VIX index.\nVariance swaps were based on an idea by Carr and Madan (1998). They\nused the entire cross-section of options, not just the at-the-money options,of a given expiration to build a portfolio whose exposure to variance was\nindependent of the underlying price. The basic idea was further formalizedby Britten-Jones and Neuberger (2000) and extended by Jiang and Tian\n(2005) to the case where the underlying paid dividends and the risk-free\nrate is nonzero. They show that the asset return\u2019s variance between two\ntimes, T\n1andT2(in the risk-neutral world), is\nE/bracketleftbig\nVT1,T2/bracketrightbig\n=2\nT\u221e/integraldisplay\n0C(T2,Kexp(rT2))\u2212C(T1,Kexp(rT1))\nK2dK (A.1)\nOr, if we consider the starting time to be the present, we can express\nthis in terms of the forward price, Ft, and only using out-of-the-money\noptions as\nE/bracketleftbig\nV01,T/bracketrightbig\n=2\nTexp(rT)\uf8ee\n\uf8f0F/integraldisplay\n0P(T,K)\nK2dK+\u221e/integraldisplay\nFC(T,K)\nK2dK\uf8f9\uf8fb (A.2)\n179\nAppA JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:13 Char Count=\n180 VOLATILITY TRADING\nActually equations (A.1) and (A.2) give a model-free implied variance;\nwhen we take the square root we introduce an upward bias by Jensen\u2019s\ninequality.\nTHE VIX INDEX\nThe Volatility Index (VIX) was introduced by the Chicago Board Options\nExchange (CBOE) in 1993. It was designed to be a benchmark index forequity market volatility. In 2003 the calculation methodology was changed\nto give a model-independent forward-looking volatility index: the S&P 500\noption market\u2019s expected value of volatility over the next 30 days. It is a dis-crete version of equation (A.2) where the integral has been approximated\nby a sum. As far as I know, the \ufb01rst study of the discrete situation was by\nDemeter\ufb01 et al. (1999), who examined in some detail the effect of using a\ufb01nite number of strikes.\nA comparison of the two methodologies for constructing the VIX is\ngiven in Carr and Wu (2006). The derivation of the fair value for the VIX isreadily available (see, for example, www.cboe.com), and the index values\nhave been back-calculated to January 2, 1990. It is very useful for testing\ntrading ideas.\nThe VIX is calculated from a weighted strip of options by the following\nformula:\n\u03c3\n2\nVIX=2\nTN/summationdisplay\ni=1/Delta1Ki\nK2\niexp(rT)V(Ki)\u22121\nT/parenleftbiggF\nK0\u22121/parenrightbigg2\n(A.3)\nF=K0+exp(rT)(C0\u2212P0)( A.4)\n/Delta1Ki=Ki+1+Ki\u22121\n2(A.5)\nwhere\nri st h er i s kf r e er a t e\nTis the expiration time (which the CBOE calculates to the minute)\nFis the forward price of the index\nK0is the strike price immediately below the forward price\nKiis the strike of the i-th out-of-the-money option\nVis the midprice of the corresponding option\nEquations (A.3) to (A.5) are applied to the \ufb01rst two option expi-\nrations, T1andT2, and we then interpolate to \ufb01nd a constant 30-day\nAppA JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:13 Char Count=\nModel-Free Implied Variance and Volatility 181\nvolatility:\nVIX=100/radicalBigg/bracketleftbigg\nT1\u03c32\nVIX 1/parenleftbiggNT2\u2212N30\nNT2\u2212NT1/parenrightbigg\n+T2\u03c32\nVIX 2/parenleftbiggN30\u2212NT1\nNT2\u2212NT1/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbiggN365\nN30\n(A.6)\nwhere NTis the number of minutes remaining for the appropriate contract\nN30=43,200 (30 \u00d71400)\nN365=525,600 (365 \u00d71400)\nAppA JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:13 Char Count=\n182\nAppB JWBK128-Sinclair March 29, 2008 20:29 Char Count=\nAPPENDIX B\nSpreadsheet\nInstructions\nIn all spreadsheets, user input is required in white cells.

We use the standard U.S. option convention where one option is for\n100 shares. The tab \u201cNormal Returns\u201d generates a GBM process from theparameters in cells N3 and N4.

Daily P/Ls\nare entered in column C and haircuts in column H. The interest rate isentered in cell E2.\nTRADING GOALS\nIn this case we simulate the results of a strategy with a given expected P/Land Sharpe ratio (cells C3 and C4). It plots 20 realizations of the processover half a year. Clearly even very good traders can have very mediocre\nresults over the short term. Use the F9 key to recalculate.\nCORRADO-SU SKEW CURVE\nThis sheet uses least squares and Solver to extract the implied volatility,\nskewness, and kurtosis consistent with the Corrado-Su model, from the\nquoted call option prices. This sheet makes use of the Solver add-in so it\nis not protected. Set the parameters in cells C2 through C4. Set the loweststrike in cell E3.

The implied volatility curve as a function of\nstrike can be produced either by entering the implied volatilities directly\ninto cells F3 through F9 or by using Solver. For example, to obtain theimplied volatility of the 35 strike, use Solver to minimize the difference\nbetween cells G3 and H3 by changing cell F3.\nMEAN REVERSION SIMULATOR\nHere we have a simulation for trading a mean-reverting process using the\nrules in Chapter 6. The tab \u201c\u2018Normal Noise\u2019 simple\u201d uses a modi\ufb01ed rule\nto enter a trade where the underlying is driven by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess with normally distributed innovations with a standard deviation ofone. The entry level is set by changing cell J3. A value of 2 means we enter\nthe trade when we deviate from fair value by two standard deviations. At\nthis point we commit half our available wealth. The position is held untilthe asset returns to fair value. The tab \u201c\u2018normal noise\u2019 exact\u201d scales our en-\ntry according to the optimal rule of equation (6.28). The fat-tailed tabs sim-\nulate the same trade but for the case where the noise is T-distributed. This\nintroduces excess kurtosis. The P/L curve generated in \u201c\u2018fat-tailed\u2019 noise\nexact\u201d shows that the scaling law of equation (6.28) is too aggressive forthis situation; however, simple rules can still be found (by adjusting cell Z3\nin tab \u201c\u2018fat-tailed\u2019 noise simple\u201d) that are pro\ufb01table.\nreso JWBK128-Sinclair March 13, 2008 22:20 Char Count=\nResources\nTrading is often about making instant decisions, generally based on in-\ncomplete information.

It contains the pricing\nformulae for over 80 types of vanilla and exotic options together with\ntheir Greeks.

The author gets into a bit of afrenzy attacking that Kelly is only applicable to trades with binaryoutcomes, and some of the notation is a little idiosyncratic, but\nmost traders would bene\ufb01t considerably from reading this book and\nworking through some of the examples. The Kelly paradigm certainlyhas problems but that is no excuse for not fully understanding it.\nA Practical Guide to Forecasting Financial Market Volatility by Ser-\nHuang Poon (John Wiley & Sons, 2005)\nThis is a solid review of the enormous academic literature. This is\na well-written summary that includes methods of forecast evaluation,\nhistorical volatility models, the GARCH family, long memory models,\nand stochastic volatility. It is aimed at \u201c\ufb01nance PhD students and prac-\ntitioners\u201d (from the Preface) and isn\u2019t an ideal book for a completebeginner. This is mainly because a lot of information is given and it\nmay be too terse. It is also supplemented by an excellent bibliogra-\nphy and a section that summarizes the results of 93 seminal volatilitystudies.\nDynamic Hedging by Nassim Taleb (John Wiley & Sons, 1996)\nThis is also a book aimed at the professional option trader. It relies\nheavily on rules of thumb for managing the risks of an options book. It\nis weaker in either providing a theoretical basis or empirical evidencefor the ef\ufb01ciency or optimality of these rules. The focus is almost en-\ntirely on managing the risk of options. There is no mention of volatil-\nity forecasting or \ufb01nding trades with positive expected value. Despitethe title, the basic question of how to hedge a position is really not\nanswered in anything other than vague generalities.

weight in the index\n- you cannot invest directly in the SP500 since it is an index, you must invest in a ETF or other product that tracks/mirrors its composition and performance\n i.e $SPY or $VOO\n\n/3\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- quarterly rebalancing of equity weights in the index \n- top 50 holdings are rebalanced annually \n\nFORMULA:\nstock weight = (stock mcap)/(total SP500 mcap)\n- there is a higher allocation of an equity with a larger market cap, hence why $AAPL is the top holding ($2.41T mcap)\n\n/4\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- there are also the SP1200, SP400 (midcap), SP600 (small cap) + SP1500\n\n- SP400 + SP600 + SP500 ==> SP1500, which covers 90% of American equity capitalization\n\nINDEX VALUE: ie SP500 @ 4117\n- calculated by\n (total mcaps)/(unknown divisor), not disclosed to the public\n/5\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHOW: \n- considered the best gauge (index) for American equity performance, thus is used as a proxy for the stock market performance\n \n- better than DJIA (DOW) since it covers more equities in more GICS sectors (500 vs 30), DJIA is price-weighter (higher price = higher weight)\n\n/6\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- better than NASDAQ, only 100 equities that are the most actively traded on the NASDAQ exchange alone\n\n- SP500 has no name overlaps in the indices, thus an equity in SP500 cannot appear in SP400\n\n-RUSSELL uses a formula to determine composition, SP uses a committee\n\n/7\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- RUSSEL index can have the same equity appear in \"value\" index as well as in \"growth\" index, since it just uses a formula\n\nWHY:\n- why do I need to pay attention to this?\n\n- many money managers and investors will use this index to gauge their performance (batting avg.)...\n\n/8\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n...and the state of the economy (incorrect assumption), so it helps to be aware of SP500 dynamics and how/when to take advantage of opportunities presented against your personal investment thesis\n\n/9\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nSP500 Limitations:\n- equal-weighted indices are popular b/c ea. stock price movement affects the index the same as one another\n- SPGlobal doesn't list all 500 holdings outside of the TOP 10 along with a sector distribution breakdown\n- 23% index weight cap\n\n/10\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- the sum of all equities with a weight > 4.8% must be <50% of the total index\n\nTO LEARN
