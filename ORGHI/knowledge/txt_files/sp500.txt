**many people already know this but it always good to look at the fine print**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT:
- mcap weighted index of 500 publicly (currently 504 constituents) traded companies 
- there are a few other filters that determine entry into the index, so not solely just largest 500 companies by mcap
- float-weighted index, weight of company is adjusted by # of...

/2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...shares available to trade, thus more liquid equities will hold a heavier weight in the index
- you cannot invest directly in the SP500 since it is an index, you must invest in a ETF or other product that tracks/mirrors its composition and performance
 i.e $SPY or $VOO

/3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- quarterly rebalancing of equity weights in the index 
- top 50 holdings are rebalanced annually 

FORMULA:
stock weight = (stock mcap)/(total SP500 mcap)
- there is a higher allocation of an equity with a larger market cap, hence why $AAPL is the top holding ($2.41T mcap)

/4

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- there are also the SP1200, SP400 (midcap), SP600 (small cap) + SP1500

- SP400 + SP600 + SP500 ==> SP1500, which covers 90% of American equity capitalization

INDEX VALUE: ie SP500 @ 4117
- calculated by
 (total mcaps)/(unknown divisor), not disclosed to the public
/5

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW: 
- considered the best gauge (index) for American equity performance, thus is used as a proxy for the stock market performance
 
- better than DJIA (DOW) since it covers more equities in more GICS sectors (500 vs 30), DJIA is price-weighter (higher price = higher weight)

/6
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- better than NASDAQ, only 100 equities that are the most actively traded on the NASDAQ exchange alone

- SP500 has no name overlaps in the indices, thus an equity in SP500 cannot appear in SP400

-RUSSELL uses a formula to determine composition, SP uses a committee

/7
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- RUSSEL index can have the same equity appear in "value" index as well as in "growth" index, since it just uses a formula

WHY:
- why do I need to pay attention to this?

- many money managers and investors will use this index to gauge their performance (batting avg.)...

/8
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...and the state of the economy (incorrect assumption), so it helps to be aware of SP500 dynamics and how/when to take advantage of opportunities presented against your personal investment thesis

/9
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
SP500 Limitations:
- equal-weighted indices are popular b/c ea. stock price movement affects the index the same as one another
- SPGlobal doesn't list all 500 holdings outside of the TOP 10 along with a sector distribution breakdown
- 23% index weight cap

/10
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- the sum of all equities with a weight > 4.8% must be <50% of the total index
